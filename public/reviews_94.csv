Jeffrey O'Brien,1,"The oee again. Nothing has changed in years. Now I can't even listen to a Playlist, it keeps reverting to a different one! Garbage. Navigating this disaster is the height of frustration. Terrible interface, buggy, everyday settings buried deep inside menus that make no sense. This service doesn't offer anything I can't get elsewhere, and no one else tortures me to use their interface. Uninstalled, again.",2025-03-15 20:24:04
Eden Valencia,5,"This is the best app ever!!!!!!! Stupid Amazon music blocks almost every song so you cant listen to it and if you get premium nothing changes, in fact they TEMPT you to buy EVEN MORE STUFF but spotifys not like that also I'm on a chrome iOS and Spotify works surprisingly well more than other apps do, although I think its only on my computer, I have to uninstall it then download to open it up. I also love a feature where you can block explicit songs so if you have any kids or you are a kid do it!",2025-03-20 16:27:31
Rheanon Adkins,1,"way more ads than music. playlist constantly closes, and you have to start over. constantly pauses for no reason. tells you 30 minutes ad free, which only crashes the ap or plays more ads. this app only gets worse with time. you can't even use it while driving because it forces you to open up the ap and physically look at the ads. dont waste your time. just go to youtube music if you want a good music app. after 10 years of use, i can happily say im uninstalling this archaic garbage.",2025-03-27 01:23:23
Teacup Appleblood,3,"Good interface, but... It'd be way better if Spotify on mobile devices was like Spotify on computers. Just look at how much more freedom you get on a computer when you listen to music in comparison with how limited the mobile version is! I don't know why it is the way it is (most likely marketing, but what isn't nowadays?)... Anyway, not really that good of an experience if you have Spotify Free but I still use it for some reason :/",2025-03-26 16:16:49
Liz Bee,1,"Terribly created app. can't turn shuffle off. Downloading your library does nothing - it cannot access it if you are not connected to internet. It downloads when it shouldn't and costs hundreds of dollars if you aren't on an unlimited data plan. It is purposely created to break if you try to skip commercials in a podcast, to the point that it must be uninstalled and reinstalled. It doesn't pay musicians or artists what they're due. It is quite literally the worst app, RIP Google play music.",2025-03-29 21:17:24
ryan pigeon,2,"Don't fall asleep with Spotify playing. it will start playing random bad podcasts, which will then forever be auto-played, with NO options to remove the unwanted programs from your lists or not play them. FIX THIS! ok app for music and podcasts, but the Adds are ridiculous! I Pay for premium to get away from the adds, but there is still 2 adds every 10 min, only now I can skip them... and you have to have signal to access downloaded songs/files, making it pointless to download them. frustrating",2025-03-21 13:41:04
Max Wen,1,"so many years and no updates to the UIX but more and more irrelevant ads. even when it says ""listen to this ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" it's a complete lie and I'll get another ad after 2 songs. sometimes I open the app and it will have a popular song of the time ready to play even though it doesn't match anything I've ever listened to, they are just trying to boost the play numbers for some artists. impossible to use this app and not see the scam this entire industry is.",2025-03-16 08:10:36
Alecia Carle,1,"Just keeps getting WORSE while charging us MORE! Premium service sucks now. You can't add/delete/rearrange songs to the queue anymore. Takes an absolutely insane amount of time for playlists to load now. And it's constantly adding the same songs to the queue... And now there's no way to remove them. Bring back all the premium features and stop taking them away! And the free version is a joke, you use to get 3-4 songs after less than a min of ads, now it's 3-4 min of ads for a song... RIDICULOUS!",2025-03-25 15:24:36
Derek DeVries,2,"Subscribed to premium service and I've been nothing but disappointed. The audio quality is good and the catalog is large, but the UI is terrible and Spotify keeps interrupting me with ads/notifications for their other services/features. They prioritize podcasts over music and there's no way to provide feedback on what you're interested in (or not): I had to subscribe to some innocuous shows just to stop them from promoting Joe Rogan every time I opened the app to listen to music.",2025-03-21 19:09:44
S Miller,5,"A slight hiccup is happening recently (January 2025... still there March 2025) - every time I open the app and click on any option, it shuts down. I can immediately reopen it and it works fine. But it seems to need to shut down at least once. I believe it's typically when I choose ""Your Library"", ""New Episodes"". Have used app for years and love it.",2025-03-20 11:04:48
Nemi Santos,1,"I used to loved this app, but now we have a lot of new issues rather than solutions. The new queue system sucks. Can't delete several songs at once. The new ""clear"" buttom only clears songs in the ""queue"" I DONT WANT TO DELETE EVERY SINGLE SONG INDIVIDUALLY! New closed captions on podcast are on the top, it's annoyin When Spotify is open on my PC and I change the volume on my phone, it only changes the volumen on my pc! This app gets worse by the minute and it's seems less worth each time!",2025-03-26 18:38:35
Tim Miller,1,Tried giving this app another chance. Still a no go. Frustrating that video function doesn't work when connected Bluetooth just because your in a moving vehicle whether your driving or not. This app is so awful and invasive! It will play by itself if you press play/pause on any other player app. TV version is even worse! So many missing functions and trying to simply find a certain Podcaster that that you've even already been listening to is a chore. Avoid at all costs. Not worth the agrivation.,2025-03-17 17:05:43
Heather cook,1,"Normally a huge fan. I have over 20000 liked songs, I make a new playlist weekly for work. It has a huge issue scrolling past the first 30 or so songs. Maybe it's time for them to break up the liked songs into two alphabetical groups of you have over a certain amount of saved songs. It's becoming impossible to do the 1 thing I really depend on the app for. Yes, I have already deleted it, cleared out the cache, redownloaded it. No avail.",2025-03-18 22:22:50
Dakota Davis,1,"An app that makes itself significantly worse so you'll pay for it, soon I'm sure they will remove the feature to even play in the background for free users. 30 minutes without ads hasn't worked in ages, even if you go in and watch the ad in the app (a horrible feature btw) after you get confirmation on 30 minutes free you WILL get an ad after your the next song. things will stop working on this app and they don't care. USE LITERALLY ANY OTHER APP IF YOU CAN, THEY DONT DESERVE YOUR MONEY",2025-03-28 09:45:22
Fizz,4,"Still love the app, but I have to say that the UI change to the queue is so intensely frustrating to me. I enjoy that it shows the album covers, but please for the love of all that is holy, separate the things I added to the queue myself from the ""next in playlist"" section again. The way it looks now is super messy to me and really messes with the way I use it.",2025-03-15 05:26:16
Brynn Sisk,2,"I have premium, and i used to adore this app. however, for the past week or so, the app will just stop playing music after a couple of songs. I have to fully close and restart the app then restart the playlist, and then the process begins all over again. it's infuriating. update, 7/24/24: this still happens sometimes, but now the issue is the removal of songs from my liked playlist. doesnt matter if i liked them years or minutes prior to checking my liked songs, certain ones just wont show up :/",2025-03-24 21:29:00
William Detlefsen,2,"This app has become increasingly clunky and riddled with ads. After listening to a downloaded podcast and deleting it, Spotify keeps it in your queue, cluttering it up and making it harder to find podcasts you haven't listened to. When fast-forwarding past intros and ads, it will randomly put you back at the beginning. If you're looking for a podcast player, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",2025-03-20 11:50:06
Zaria D,3,"I've been using Spotify for years and I'll admit, it's the best music app you can use. But lately, my reset button hasn't been available and it's causing me trouble. I've tried resetting the playlists, nothing. Closing then reopening the app, nothing. I'm going to see if updating the app will help. Update 1: Still didn't workðŸ˜“ Update 2: Even tried logging out, didn't work. Update 3: Even redownloaded the app, nothing. Update 4: Spotify, what happened!? Why is the whole app getting worse!?",2025-03-28 04:54:21
Hellish Champion,1,started ok rapidly turning it's self into garbage. number of ads keeps increasing. I download to listen later so I don't waste data. they have data saving options like do not randomly play something when playback is over. I have that enabled and yet after every downloaded podcasts it starts playing hip hop. I have never listened to music on this app and can't get it to stop. do what every1 else does and use something else.,2025-03-27 18:06:25
Brian Eyman,2,"I love this app. listen to podcasts every day. until today. it's doing nothing but cache. and causing high battery drain the second I open it. even after clearing cach. please fix devs. of Spotify!!! so i can resume listening. It's been great for many years till now. completely unusable now. after it's fixed, I'll update my rating.",2025-03-22 18:20:31
Nathan Telkamp,2,"Spotify keeps stopping media playback in all other apps whenever it is running in the background (not playing music, just being open). It's super frustrating. I have to force stop spotify any time I want to watch a YouTube video or listen to a Pandora station or anything, because it just repeatedly pauses whatever I'm trying to play. Samsung S22 Ultra. Please fix this. Edit: Yes, I have tried reinstalling. I still have the issue",2025-03-22 04:40:38
Kimberly V,3,"This would be a 5 star app but all of this month I've been experiencing issues, specifically since March 10th, the latest update. I cannot go back to a previous song or restart a song! And this is a problem for me because I am the type of gal to return to a song when I feel like I'm not appreciating it enough. Also, on my PS5, my music will go on an ultimate loop of 1 advertisement until I restart the app. Please let me go back/rewind songs and fix my PS5's Spotify issue!",2025-03-19 19:52:25
Allen Edwards,3,"good music and interface but the auto switching between devices and the always running in the background of my phone is very annoying. I have disabled the ability to run in the background, force stopped the app and somehow when I am listening on my computer it will randomly switch to my phone. or randomly I will find the Spotify player in the device toolbar open and playing even though I never had the open open. Spotify is auto opening the app in the background without my permission.",2025-03-24 13:30:54
Julie Davoll,4,"awesome selection of songs. It just sucks when you have 100 hrs worth of songs, but the same songs will play during the day when you put your list on shuffle, which is what you need to do unless you want the exact same songs in the exact same order each time. Basically, for example, you get to hear the same 200 songs all the time when you have 15,000 songs in your playlist.",2025-03-29 12:30:19
Andrea K,5,"This review is mostly for the customer service. I had one teenie tiny issue going on with my app so I contacted the developer and was absolutely blown away. They were all over it instantly. Going through troubleshooting and everything that could possibly be bugging my app. after a couple days they finally found a fix and my app works flawlessly again. This has always been my go to for podcasts and after this experience, I will not use anything else.",2025-03-27 23:57:02
Chad,1,"Downloaded songs and shuffle ruin the app. I use the app a lot out of service area so I download plenty of music to listen to. When I try to listen to the downloaded music the app only plays rap and hip hop, plays the same 10 songs over and over again out of 2500 plus downloaded songs. It sometimes won't even play other songs I try to select outside the apps chosen favorites, I click on it and it does nothing. It ruins the whole experience of using the app.",2025-03-05 16:08:07
DeWitt Powers,2,"One step forward, two steps back. The updated queue is nice for swiping songs away, but now it sucks for removing multiple songs at once. It makes it easier to accidentally play the song instead of removing it too. The add to playlist function is broken now after the much needed multi-playlist update. Now if you hit the back button on your phone or in the app, it will clear all your playlists you've added so far and either start you over or close the add to playlist screen altogether. Annoying.",2025-03-05 19:55:06
Pyroshock,1,"When using the Free version of this app, searching and playing a song is broken. For example, if I search and play ""Billie Jean"" by MJ, it will play ""Beat it"" or ""Thriller"". Earlier versions of spotify did not do this and it makes this app one of the most unreliable apps for Free music playing - along with your procured playlists on permenant shuffle. You'd be better off with competitor products. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - unless you have over 100 dollars a year to blow on premium.",2025-03-09 14:48:02
Davis Glazebrook,2,"The only thing consistent about Spotify is how frustrating it is. UX And UI change all the time from bad to bad, never gets better. Pay Artists More!! Stop with the limited audiobook credits, paid promotions on premium, and AI garbage like the dj. Let me find new music from artists I follow Instead of burying the releases menu that doesn't even show all of them!! I could write a book about how much I hate this app.",2025-03-12 00:25:46
Isabella Cila (BavenTheRaven),1,"Unusable without premium. They remove basic features and lock them behind premium for the mobile app. The desktop version is the only usable one, there too many ads otherwise and they keep changing the ui to absolute garbage. Last time I checked they removed the ability to loop just one song if it's in a playlist. Premium isn't even affordable, just a straight up cashgrab from a greedy company. Go use SoundCloud, At least they let you loop songs for free.",2025-03-05 19:18:03
Ivy,5,"Music is EVERYTHING. It makes me calm, relaxed, and just be in my little small world! I love how I get to do my playlist!! I would use this everywhere I go. In my car, my room, outside, in school, in stores, when I'm bored, when I feel happy/sad, I just love this so much and I'm being so fr! Literally all the songs one needs/knows. The same goes for the podcasts! EVERYTHING is on Spotify with entertaining playlists made by so many people! It is easy and fun to use!! Best app for music/podcasts!!",2025-03-17 03:40:19
Christina Porter,3,"Used to have a 2 star rating for the app in 2023, and major issues have been updated, but i still continue to have some issues with songs randomly pausing and not playing. The ads are also insane. 3 to 4 30 second ads in a row after only playing a few songs is very irritating to say the least. I don't have the money to be spending $12/mo for premium so it is what it is, but it gets annoying. Otherwise, app is pretty good for listening to music whenever, driving, walking, etc.",2025-02-06 10:02:08
Julian Eaddy,2,"The app works, but barely. It will throw ads at you every other song, and the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is 5-8 minutes at best. On top of that, basic features such as rewinding or skipping a song are lost behind the Premium Paywall (which gets more expensive every 3 months). You can't even pick which song you want to listen to on your playlist, as it's stuck in shuffle mode. It's glitchy. When I opened my phone, music started playing, and it jacked up my volume to max. I'm done. ðŸ‘Ž",2025-02-21 18:03:08
Rachel S.,1,"Suddenly stopped working today. Anytime I go to my library, the app closes. If I even try to play a local file downloaded on my phone, it closes. I've been having a bug for many months where the app would close the first time I went to the ""New Episodes"" podcast playlist, but it was a minor annoyance. This is completely unusable. Frustrating that it happened the day after my monthly Premium charge happened! Hope it will be fixed soon.",2025-02-23 08:47:54
Miguel.,5,"On my device, it's awesome. I use this everyday, everywhere and always, for over 50,000 minutes. Other than the ads (which aren't too annoying once, again, on my device) it's pretty much perfect. I just don't enjoy how some songs are unavailable because of regions, but it's not a big issue since the mainstream is there as well as a lot of underground. There's not much to complain about, since I use the free version. So far, i say this is great.",2025-01-15 02:57:35
Spook Spook,1,"It's just ad after ad after another ad. The only pro is that virtually every artist is available, but even then, there are other services with that same variety and fewer ads. Even some features are locked behind a pay wall. I shouldn't have to spend $7+ a month just to turn off shuffle. Plus, their lyrics are broken and are often times faster or slower than the song.",2025-02-18 02:49:52
Cindie Dowell,2,"Why remove the ability to delete a song from the play queue? I don't understand why I pay for an app that tries to control everything I listen to. Isn't that the whole point of paying? That, plus the fake ""shuffle"" feature makes me hate Spotify. Again, if it's a playlist I made, I like all of the songs! I don't need Spotify to play 5% of them over and over for me and never play the other 95%. I suppose it's time to find a new music service.",2025-03-01 13:56:42
Lily W,4,"Spotify is a pretty decent music app. It more likely than not has any song you search for, and the design is simple and easy to work with. However, it does have some faults: the ads, and premium. I will get an ad that tells me that the next 30 minutes of listening will be ad free, then two songs later and I get four ads. It's impractical and misleading. There are some perks with Premium, but I should not have to pay to be able to skip songs freely. That's just kinda bogus.",2025-02-21 23:52:26
Brandy Lutz,1,"Can't look up an artist and see their album to add songs to my playlist. I have to look up each song. I also can't pick a song and listen because Spotify will only play a different song. You already get money from making me listen to ads. I'm on a limited income and can't afford to pay a monthly fee. Also, throwing in random songs on my playlist that I didn't add is not welcome. I want to hear my choices. This makes me not want to use Spotify at all. I'll find a better music app.",2025-02-01 01:54:29
Jo Batson,5,"I love using Spotify. However, I wish they would bring the option back to rearrange your Playlist via the mobile app, especially when you're paying for Premium Service. Having to login via the internet or computer is an inconvenience when you're paying for the service monthly you should be able to change the order of the songs via the app. **sigh** :-(",2025-02-09 02:35:31
Jamie Cagle,1,"App continuously just keeps pausing my music if I do literally anything else on my phone while using it. I have my playlist downloaded, as I use it for playing music over the speaker at work. I've tried clearing my downloads, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app,and nothing fixes it. I try to open up any other app or my browser and it hard stops the music. Does this while I'm driving as well. My phone has space and this is the only app giving me such recurring problems.",2025-02-03 16:33:25
Chili waffles,4,"Spotify is great. thereâ€™s a huge variety of music. Iâ€™ve only come across one thing I couldnâ€™t find (A Groovy Thing, By Flamingosis). I really like making playlists and organizing them into folders. Premium is definitely worth it, no ads, unlimited skips, and downloading playlists. Itâ€™s also really easy to connect to a TV or gaming console. Spotify is better than other platforms, especially since the music keeps playing in the background.",2025-01-22 23:38:47
Annastacia Monroe,1,"Very unhappy with the video constantly playing on the home screen. It's irritating. For the longest time Spotify was the ONE app that didn't have jarring overstimulating videos in your face. Not anymore I guess. It makes me dread opening the app, especially because I used to use Spotify to relax from a hard day. I Just want music. There should be an option to remove the videos from the home screen. It's obvious that Spotify is trying to be the next Tik Tok or social media app.",2025-02-14 19:14:54
keith saylor,1,"TOOK AWAY THE LAST GOOD THING ABOUT SPOTIFY, the queue!! Used to be able to click queue and select random songs from library in the queue to play next, now you can't, have to individually drag each song to the top. Absolute trash. EVERY single update Spotify has done for the last 5 years has made the app worse and worse. Used to be the best, can't get my 7000 songs off the damn app without starting completely over on something else, no transfer apps work. So effing mad.",2025-01-17 00:11:53
Amber Desjarlais,5,"I've used this app for 13 years, and it's the best music app out of all of them. Highly recommend! Edit: Why did the ""search in your library"" feature changed. I really enjoyed searching an artist and having all of the songs I like come up instead of making individual playlists of all the artists. Now, it shuffles through my library playlist instead of the searched songs. It's a bummer!",2025-01-11 16:48:32
Dean Johnson,4,"Have always liked the app. But recently I've been having some issues. I use my ""liked songs"" playlist the most. About 2700 songs. And when I click on the song, it takes a hot second to play it. And if you click another, it will continue to play the original for at least 2 seconds before it changes. As well as if I scroll through the songs, pick one, switch to a different app, then come back, and it brings up songs that are higher in my list. Could just be me but idk.",2025-01-18 19:55:25
Erica Northup,3,"Used to be able to listen to it all day with no issues. Then, at the end of 2024, I'd get 20 minutes of music, and it gets stuck on an ad. I've looked into it numerous times and was told it's my wifi. My wifi is fine. It's the app. This needs to be fixed, or the apps are going to lose a lot of people to Pandora or YouTube.

Endless Abyss,1,"My music keeps stopping and wont unpause unless I open the app and unpause it. When I unpause it, it starts the song from the beginning.

Mack,3,"It's okay. Queue has a lot of issues. The recent update makes it so you can't re-add or delete songs from the queue, you can't select multiple songs to delete or re-add them there, (and if you can, the option to is not clear) and even before that update when I'd try re-adding songs to my queue from it, it would jumble my order up and I'd have to manually rearrange it again, or sometimes put it into my ""next in playlist"" rather than ""queue"" section.",2025-02-17 08:59:34

James Keplinger,2,"Not good. They don't have an issue taking your money but won't give any support. Actually terrible support. If you use them, if something goes wrong your option is too download a different app. Having issues with app randomly playing and opening on multiple device at one time,so after 2 hours on chat they just disconnect you if they can't provide a simple fix.",2025-02-25 19:26:18
Vin K,1,"Update: Nothing has changed from my previous review. Additionally they have updated the queue function and it's terribly ugly and less useful than it used to be with the addition of 3 useless buttons at the bottom that hog up the screen. The buttons are offered literally on the normal playback screen but they have bloated them into the queue UI. Price has increased year over year, The audiobook section is pricegated even for subscription holders, and they pay the artists pennies on the dollar.",2025-02-15 22:53:42
Tanz Afroz,2,"Good selection but needs a better UI like long press to select multiple songs/media. It is such a a pain that you can only move one song at a time in a playlist. When playing from an album or playlist, we need a button to start it over instead of playing from where it was left off. Swipe left to delete. The whole queue should be cleared with one press instead of clearing it twice. I don't know why the Spotify developers don't add these basic features!!",2025-02-21 06:42:15
Cam Deguffroy,5,"Spotify is the most amazing app that I have ever downloaded, it has like every single song that exists, and offers most songs in different languages (if u don't speak English). The only thing that I would like them 2 improve is the lyrics and time sinking them. They r most likely 2 fix it if you report it, and when u do it takes like 1-2 weeks to be fixed. But this app does not only have music it has podcasts, a DJ that makes playlist for you, episodes of craters strate from YouTube and more",2025-02-08 03:46:16
Solange Roman,1,"Would you like a music app that can shuffle? Find a different one! Constantly adding new songs to playlist only to have the same 50 always play in the same pattern. Hit shuffle again? Nope, same. It's awful, it makes no sense and forces u to use their ai dj to actually mix it up. Updating to say it still cannot shuffle.",2025-02-27 09:50:47
avenley friday,4,"i love spotify, definitely my favorite music service and one of my favorite apps in general but THE ADS. i dont understand why there are so many ads in such a long line, and theyre played more than songs are. i can tell you, ive listened to my favorite song (formidable by twenty one pilots) probably 90 times (since i started tracking the music). and ive listened to to lowes advert over 105 timesðŸ˜­ can we please cut down on th ads just a bit???",2025-01-24 03:12:55
Julie Stillman,3,"Great app to listen to music, but when I get the ""30 minutes ad free"" part, it's not 30 minutes it's just one song, maybe two before another ad pops up and sometimes its multiple ads in a row. It's really annoying when I try to listen to music to fall asleep, and i keep hearing ads.",2025-02-11 07:47:21
April Moon,5,"OK so only improvement I can really see at this point is with the podcast experience. I'd like it if when I select under Filter & Sort that it would stay with my selection instead of resetting to All Episodes vs that I'd like it to stay on Unplayed Episodes only every time I come back next day or whenever. but unfortunately i come back later to reset filters and end messing up on which episode I left off on. otherwise, my favorite for all audio Streaming enjoyment",2025-01-16 05:30:44
Michael Nelson,1,"Honestly, just use any other app that provides music streaming. Loading up Spotify to see that my playlist of two thousand or more songs doesn't display properly and can't be edited is beyond frustrating. I spent years building a profile of music that I enjoy, just for the platform I made it on to completely nullify all my progress. Playlists change as the person who created them does; so, being able to edit them, let alone see the tracks in them, is pretty important.",2025-03-06 03:14:05
Elizabeth Sampson,2,"The quality, for the most part, is fine. But two things that have really irked me: first, and most importantly, IT HAS NO TRUE SHUFFLE. Unless that's ever changed, my rating will not go up. Second, if a friend shares a song link with me, clicking on it automatically plays the song and interrupts whatever playlist I may have had going instead of just taking me to the song info and giving me a choice to play it or not. Would be nice if it didn't do that.",2025-01-06 03:16:24
Hannah Soules,4,"I've used this app for several years. I don't pay for premium, and I've never really minded the ads. Sometimes it'll give you four ads back to back and then promise you 30 minutes of ad-free listening, only to play you an ad after the next couple of songs. That's super annoying and is why I docked a star. But it doesn't happen all the time. After the most recent update (Dec 2024?), it would only play one song and then stop completely. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it fixed the issue.",2025-01-05 22:28:03
Sue Ann Lopez,1,"I LOVE when I use it on my tv & a song I REALLY LOVE comes on & after it's over I can REWIND IT & PLAY IT AGAIN!!! I CAN'T do that when I use it in my car or my phone & I HATE THAT!!! WTH is going on with the app it keeps freezing up, stops playing after 1 song & I have to uninstall it and download it again EVERY SINGLE TIME for it to work???!!!! Please fix ASAP!!! Thanks in advance. I'M SO TIRED OF ADS EVERY 2 OR 3 SONGS WHEN IT SAYS TO ENJOY 30 MINUTES OF UNINTERRUPTED MUSIC!!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡",2025-01-11 13:33:51
Brianna Mullen,1,"I'm not sure what caused this glitch to be happening constantly, but whenever I try to play something and then skip to the song I want to hear, it stops playing everything entirely and it is getting very annoying. I'm tired of not being able to listen to anything after I skip something. Please fix this or else I am uninstalling and switching to another music provider. I am SEVERELY disappointed.",2025-01-04 06:52:35
Effie,2,"I've been using Spotify for almost 10 years. I've noticed that the app no longer shuffles my playlits, so the same songs keep playing over and over again. I'm on the premium plan, yet I'm still getting ads on podcasts and I don't have access to audio books. There are some podcasts that I used to listen to almost daily that have now become locked. What's the point of paying for a premium subscription if I don't gain access to everything the app offers?",2025-01-10 02:44:29
Mara* Ponce,4,"1. I want to listen to playlist folders on shuffle in the mobile app. It's dumb that we can do it on the desktop app but not mobile. 2. I want a bigger space to manage my playlists. I hate the tiny sidebar! I want to toggle between thumbnails and list-view in the primary windrow. 3. I want to be able to click on a track and see what playlists I have added it to, without first trying to add it to get the ""already on this playlist, add again?"" notice. Thank you",2025-01-08 20:27:04
Alexis Jakubiak,2,"I've used Spotify premium for years and don't want to start over on a different service, but lately it's glitchy, the algorithm and shuffle are way too repetitive, and the app randomly clears my queue all the time. I mainly use it to play music in my car, and sometimes if I hit pause for just a few minutes, I return and it's cleared my whole queue. Sometimes it even resumes playing at first but then does this. App used to be amazing but functionality has decreased. Please fix!!!",2024-10-13 20:30:01
Alexis Gentile,2,"It plays music and you can use it with third party sites to check stats, that's about it for the positives. The random is far from random, when you finish listening to an album you get the same one or two songs that pop up every time, the daylists are stale and quickly become self-perpetuating, many bands are still missing songs and albums, new playlists are public by default, the whole thing is a mess and crashes often when i'm driving. I miss google music.",2024-10-25 03:33:35
HeatherLee S,2,"I had to edit my review, it used to be 5 stars but I'm lowering it because all of the sudden, every now and then, it'll switch what Im listening to. I've been listening to a podcast's library and it switched me to a curated list. If you want to make me a recommended list, fine but I don't HAVE to listen to that other stuff and this app is making it so I have to. Super inconvenient, especially while driving. I've used this app for years and never had any issues until recently.",2024-12-10 22:13:15
A ito,1,"I hate to say this, but Spotify is honestly a really bad music app. Ive been using it for years, and Ive loved it throughout, but these updates just keep getting worse and worse. To enjoy your experience, you more or less have to pay for Premium. They've gotten extremely money-hungry, not to mention the app doesn't even work half the time. My music often randomly stops playing for no reason. Also, not being able to see lyrics without Premium really bothers me. Dont recommend.",2024-12-28 02:07:05
Kayleigh Rhodes,2,"I use a 12 hour podcast for brown noise overnight. I've done this for years. For the past 2 months, Spotify skips 1-2 hours into the episode, waking me up. I've tried all of the troubleshooting tips on the help forums, NOTHING is helping. I'm so frustrated, this is such a dumb issue. I noticed that it doesn't matter the length of the podcast, it's just started skipping a lot of them.

Jesse Patoka,1,"New review: for whatever reason the app stopped letting me add songs to my liked song playlist, or add podcast episodes to my ""your episodes"" playlist.

Also, their podcasts controls have improved a lot and is actually an option to use now.",2024-12-16 01:31:50
Ashlyn Snyder,5,"Love using Spotify, it's great! Recently been experiencing a weird issue with my new phone (android) where if I play music for too long, the music will stop, play for a few seconds, stop again, and repeat this cycle until I open my phone. It doesn't last long though. I've restarted the phone & tried uninstalling but it happens still (less frequently though!). Regardless, I still love using this app",2024-11-24 16:06:50
Taylor Dixson,2,"App has become horribly unstable. The app crashes on me every other song, sometimes I get two songs in-between. I have reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, undownloaded and redownloaded all saved playlist. But the app still crashes constantly. Not worth the membership cost anymore, given that I can't enjoy my music. I hope it gets fixed with the next update, but considering the issue wasn't fixed after the last time I brought this issue up, I'm not hopeful.",2024-12-10 21:44:37
Tara,2,"The app itself is okay, but after a few updates, all the stuff I was able to have is hidden behind a pay wallðŸ˜“ And sometimes, if you make a playlist and play it, it'll have some random song that isn't even listed or added by the app itself.

Michael G (Space Cadet),2,"I've had to change my review to Spotify because they've made it intolerably bad to use. They keep removing and changing features so that hands-free is just not an option anymore. I mostly use Spotify in the car and on Sonos. There are no hands-free options at all, Google Assistant seems to intentionally pick any song except what you want. You can't switch playlists without fumbling through your screen. I will say the Sonos has significantly improved and is now usable. Still useless in the car.",2024-10-19 07:50:53
Mandy Karja,2,"The app is a great app, very convenient to have the music still be able to play even if I wanna use another app. Although it irritates me when it plays songs that are not apart of my playlist. I eventually run out of skips because I only want to listen to the music on my playlist. I switched back to YouTube because they don't play random music that isn't on my playlist. Please add an option that makes so you can choose to have recommended songs play.",2024-12-30 04:21:13

""Upstream request"" timeouts when I try to access their website. Player won't work on desktop. Wrapped won't play. I restart the app. I install updates. I check settings. I try different browsers.

Courtney Mary,2,"Always loved this app. I pay for premium but you still add commercials even though I pay to not have commercials. Granted they can be skipped, but I don't EVEN WANT THEM THATS THE POINT OF PAYING NOT TO HAVE THEM, having the ability to skip is pointless when I have to pick up my phone a million times during a podcast to skip the stupid BOSE headphones commercials. Per Spotify they told me to contact customer support, which I have, and they've never responded or fixed it.",2024-11-15 16:53:46
Kayleen Stokes,4,"I've been using Spotify for a WHILE, and I haven't experienced any issues except for on mine, after a song finishes, it just stays at the end of that song and doesn't play to the next.

Please fix this bug!!",2024-12-22 04:39:24
Kimber Mcgahan,3,"Honestly, when i first started using this, it was an awesome app! It's got all my favorite artists in one place, but, after a while, on my phone, it just doesn't work(?) It will not play the next song, and it will get stuck on an ad, which i can't skip since I have to close the app. But overall, it's a great app, aside from the fact that you only have limited lyrics per month and six skins per hour, I love it! It's great for people who have money to spend on premium. (Aside from me, I dont)",2024-12-22 12:07:15
Haley Powell,5,"Amazing app. I love it. But I have noticed a lot of times when it says ""you have 30 mins of no ads"" alot of times it will only play one song and then a ad will follow and it's kinda annoying.

Laela Overmoyer,1,"The music and audiobook features are fantastic, but the podcast features are awful. Even premium means you have ads on podcasts, and if you want to replay the few seconds before ads you have to listen to the ads again. It claims that your input on the ads matters, but it doesn't. I wouldn't mind, except that the ads I get are the same awful ones all the time. It makes me 1. Actively avoid the product advertised and 2. Avoid listening to any podcast on Spotify.",2024-11-27 03:41:13
Shailiah Kermani,1,"I made the questionable choice to pay for this awful app, and every day I wish I had any better option. The playlists will randomly unshuffle after playing 2-3 songs, will repeat songs I literally just heard like 15 minutes ago in the same order, and makes it incredibly frustrating to try to stay on your actual playlist, instead sending you to some random ""Here's what we think you'll like.""

They kneecapped our ability to find new releases, especially if they're outside the bucket of genres that Spotify plops us into. They used to have a robust list of new releases that you could browse through, but now not so much. The app had a fantastic equalizer in settings that's now basically useless. We also lost the ability to use the preset adjustments that tweaked the bass/trebel based on your age. Down to 3 stars from 5.",2024-11-06 22:55:38
