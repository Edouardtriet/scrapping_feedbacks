Willem van Heerden,1,"A couple of annoying bugs have crept in recently, and it's impossible to report these problems. This is unacceptable for such a widely used app. On the Pixel Watch 3 one can choose to not receive notifications while the phone is open. This works in every app except WhatsApp, meaning that the watch vibrates with every message received, even as I'm replying to them. Annoying and a massive battery drain. Why is it so hard to report bugs?",2025-03-12 18:48:19
Mike Moritz,1,"Updates always break functionality while adding ""features"" nobody asked for. Updated Feb2025. WA now opens a menu of file types when attaching something. Before you could just pick what you wanted. It doesn't display all my albums when sending pics. Long pressing the ""gallery"" file type opens my photo gallery but it's buggy and slower and doesn't display mp4 or all of my gifs like it did before. I now have to share my files from my gallery app to WA as a work-around. I dread their updates.",2025-02-19 17:05:38
Oscar Q,1,"I was really hoping for a smooth messaging experience, but WhatsApp has been a letdown. The app frequently crashes and the notifications are inconsistent, which makes it frustrating to keep up with conversations. Plus, the user interface can feel cluttered at times. I also have concerns about privacy and data security. Overall, I expected more from such a popular app. Time to look for alternatives",2025-01-18 09:17:05
A Google user,2,"I noticed that recently after updates, when listening to voice notes, if it's a long voice note the voice note will stop when the screen goes off. Dunno why it's doing this. Before it wasn't like that. Also noticed that missed calls are not shown on screen, but only when you open WA and check you chats you will see the missed call label inside the chat. Please work on a feature that allows you to block Whatsapp video/ calls in general or for a scheduled time.",2024-11-25 13:53:54
zahra,2,Love WhatsApp but there is a glitch that is very annoying. When I scroll ust a little bit up it jumps up hours earlier randomly. It happens very often and is confusing and annoying. Please look into this! Also please have a feature to disable or lock the video message feature because when scrolling it gets clicked on accident and is very annoying,2024-10-26 15:29:40
hu trillz,4,"Just started using the app and I'd happily give 5 stars if it were solely based on the product's simplicity design, and operating abilities, however I'd like to make 2 (obvious) suggestions. 1. Being a translate feature and perhaps have in settings a setting to set your preferred translating language. Also, on the topic, many prominent websites are offering live video call translating capabilities, might be worth considering. 2. A more clear account/profile accessibility button/page/feature.",2024-12-07 09:48:36
astroturtle,1,"FIX THE BUG THAT FORGETS YOUR LOGIN AND FORCES YOU TO RESTORE EVERYTHING. On every device, ""You have been logged out"" without ANY reason. And how is it possible to have WhatsApp set to ""daily"" backups, and then the most recent backup is from over a month ago? A month of messages, images, docs, videos, just gone because your app can't even do a BASIC BACKUP properly. Garbage app. The only reason I keep using this thing is because other people.",2024-12-21 19:55:22
Denise Martinez,2,"Fix This Bug: Having issues with accessing the gallery on my phone. App has access, but my albums do not show up in the option to send photos. Can't see all my photo/video albums Currently, when I try to share a picture or video on WhatsApp directly, it doesn't let me see all my folders. Many other users are having the same issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times.",2025-01-16 10:37:08
Alexius Emejom,4,"Very easy-to-use UI. I am not a fan of the latest updates to the Status updates interface that is displayed horizontally. I prefer the original vertical display for the status updates. I wish WhatsApp could revert to that view. Also, maybe the communities could be organized on another tab to free up space for status updates.",2024-09-28 14:43:29
Kaveen Amarasekara (ARMKT),4,"Thrilled to say this is has become my primary chat app for years. Recently, it has developed and improved a lot. New features, new experiences. The UI/UX is getting changed everyday. Yeah, overall experience is good. But, I have some complaints/ suggestions too. Most of the times when I open the app, it's look kinda mess. All the direct and group chats in the same interface so looks weird. So, first I suggest you to separate these to into two in the same page using tabs or whatever.",2025-03-14 04:42:05
K R,2,whoever had the idea to change the sound output from speaker mode to call mode anytime the camera was covered was severely misinformed. this is an incredibly annoying feature. I have to restart voice notes anytime a shadow crosses my camera. Anytime i put my phone in my pocket. and there is no way to turn this feature off. remove this feature--it's incredibly inconvenient and it makes an already kind of clunky app way way worse. on top of all that they track your data and use it for ads. fun.,2025-03-23 20:40:44
Ron Beach,1,"Installed the app and just set up an account but did not use it at all. 3 hours later the account was blocked and when I attempt to send a review request it just says ""something went wrong ease try again."" Tried to reinstall but nothing changes. Triex to contact customer service but I just get a bot that goes in circles. Not a good experience. Still have not been able to send or receive anything.",2025-03-11 00:15:56
Clif Jackson,4,Works great only don't think that is what's app or even your internet that's causing you're connection to be slow or be dropped... It's very much got too do with your actual phones intenna more than anything else I wanna say... So if it's been over 6 months since you've bought or upgraded... Then your gonna have issues.. Once again not the actual app or your internet provider but your phone that's a POS. Almost like they made them to do that before long??? App works great overall!!!!,2025-03-07 14:58:56
G R,4,"Becoming cluttered. Still good UI. Calls are pretty reliable. Like that you can send/receive pictures and files. Unfortunately, they continue display all landline & toll-free numbers in your Whatsapp phone book with an ""Invite a Friend"" link. Even if already listed as whatsapp users. NO WAY to hide/remove. Meta trying hard to get you to invite everyone to use whatsapp. Wish I could hide the Channels option. If I wanted Facebook, I would have installed it on my phone!",2025-03-20 16:58:42
Emmanuel Mokwena,4,"I didn't give 5 stars for one reason. When I try to use the app in landscape mode, it is always glitchy and barely works. But other than that, I'm fully satisfied. Edit: Now there is another issue, there is a new list feature that was released a few weeks ago. I only had it for about a week, and it was gone. I tried restarting my WhatsApp, deleting it, and installing it again. Nothing worked. If this could be resolved,I would appreciate it.",2025-03-19 17:25:27
Scott,5,"User friendly. The UI is clean and it's easy to communicate with people and share files. For privacy it does it's job good enough. It has end-end encryption and allows a p2p connection with another. A reminder that this app itself can and may store data, metadata, messages, and files regarding your use. The developer has to abide by the law in order to continue to be sustainable. Personally, I wouldn't use it to share sensitive data. I would use another layer of pgp or an Open GNU program.",2025-03-16 16:38:16
Anu A,1,"Voice Message stops on its own after few seconds. I pressed the Voice message button and I was going on and on, only to find out the recording had stopped on it's own after few seconds, thought it was my fault and started over again, and again, and again!!! this problem has been going on for weeks now.",2025-03-28 05:02:53
Karl Madison,1,"forced updates. after being forced to update, haven't been getting notifications the past month or two. doesn't allow editing messages after a few minutes. doesn't allow deleting messages after a short time. I don't want to use timed messages, I want to individually delete any messages from both receiver and sender at will. can't edit or delete history. telegram is better in every way.",2025-03-24 16:06:33
Sarah Estes,1,"I have been trying to get my account unlocked after it was (as admitted through the review) mistakenly marked as spam. Yet it has been over 24 hours and I can't even login. I was given no warning, suddenly a message just appeared saying I wasn't allowed access. I've tried multiple times to get in touch. The one time a call actually came it hung up before giving me the verification code. You made a mistake, you need to fix whatever is going on",2025-03-08 17:50:13
Corey Hernandez (Parkorey),2,"Have been using app for years. It was fantastic initially, but lately the quality of the app has gone way down. Calls have been dropping more and more frequently. Video quality has become very pixelated. App has been glitching and saying I decline peoples calls when I never declined them, most times phone won't even ring and I'll have half a dozen missed calls all arrive at once. Shame, was a great app for a while. Hopefully they can fix all these glitches, but it's been like this for months.",2025-03-01 23:18:08
Ruben Sanchez Gonzalez,2,"Since meta bought this app, it has been declining both in quality and functionality. Vocie messages. If you leave a draft, a lot of times you'll lose your message. If you pause while recording a voice note, it stops preventing the screen from turning off, so it interrupts your message. Is there are 2 or more voice notes to be played, you can't just play one, leave the app to do something else, and keep auto play the rest. It just stops. All in all, quality worsening each day.",2025-02-27 02:28:22
Henry Ofori,4,"WhatsApp Messenger is good 👍🏼 for communication from all locations. It helps to forward images, files, documents, and other links to help reach more people and set plans for your support. The main difficulty it shows when making a call is: ""connecting/reconnecting"", which I think is from the network. When this statement shows no voices are heard 😒, either you called or you're receiving a call from others. It's great 👍🏼 in sharing current status and chatting with families and friends 🧡.",2025-01-31 15:01:01
Sean,1,"Jesus christ, app developers: stop changing things people use every day for no good reason. Don't move the button to attach photos from the gallery to the opposite side of the screen, so now I reflexively keep hitting ""attach location"" or whatever. Don't make it so the slider sometimes refuses to appear and I can't quickly scroll back through photos from a long time ago. It worked fine. Leave it alone.",2025-02-25 04:23:35
kevin whisenant,1,"Unfortunately, I can't send msgs from my watch. I receive them fine but when I reply, they're stuck pending with the clock icon. They'll only send if I force close the app and open it up again. But lately that hasn't been working either. Loading voice msgs often times gets stuck spinning and never loads. I have the LTE version and everything else works fine. No issues on my phone. This happens whether I'm on WiFi or LTE. I've tried uninstalling, restarting, force closing. Nothing fixes it.",2025-02-15 15:11:47
Mwape Chimpampa,4,"I really like the app. It makes things so easy. But I still have some suggestions, not really complaints. I really think that it would be good for a feature to be added for people to copy the text on their status post, so that if they typed anything wrong, they can copy, delete, paste and make the minor edits needed instead of typing everything all over again. And if another feature to allow one to change to view once anything they forgot to send as a view once by a simple tap, that would be 👍",2025-02-09 11:25:09
Connor Hawke,1,"Gone. WhatsApp suddenly lost all my messages. It wasn't even open. One day I opened the app and it said it would try to restore my chat history from backup. It failed. Many others have had the same issue; search Google. The fix to get some (but probably not all) of your data back is long-winded and may require rooting your phone. I'm no longer using WhatsApp. Also: critical bugs on Android, including missing messages/media in exports. Customer service is either AI or illiterate. Use another app.",2025-02-07 03:30:05
Roman Abreu,1,"There's a very annoying voice messaging bug that has been going on for months where for some reason the volume is so low that even at max volume you can barely hear them. Initially I thought it was my current phone but recently I've received voice notes from iPhone users with the exact same issue, and it's not only annoying but dangerous as sometimes one can forget to lower the volume before playing something else. Please fix it!!",2025-02-14 00:29:41
Yoel Teitelbaum,1,"This is the worst app when it comes to switching devices. There is no one to talk to except an AI that keeps repeating the same useless response over and over. It's a shame that, in this day and age, the process is so complicated, takes so long, and still ends up failing. It's time for real investors to take over and fix it."" my advice if you need this for business don't touch it use some alternative messaging services there are plenty out there",2025-02-20 20:41:23
Michael Eiland,2,"Very unhappy. For some reason when choosing a picture to send in a message, of all my albums in my gallery, only 5 are visible to select from. This was never the case before up till now. I only can select pictures from camera folder, recents folder, downloads folder, whatsapp and screenshot folders. If I click the 3 buttons top right only cloud apps is there. This means if I have a picture in another folder I have to transfer it to one of these to be able to send it in whatsapp. Permission on",2025-01-28 03:43:17
Heather Strojan,3,"why don't the GIFs work. They don't continue to run at all in fact they stop quicker then ever, press play and stops. Every other app I have the GIFs never stop which I the whole point of even using them. also now I can't tell if someone is recording a voice message at the top when in the message, it's now a microphone 🎤 at the bottom. stop changing things",2025-03-25 20:34:49
Dino Bettini,2,"They removed the ""show notifications"" option when muting a group. This is such a downgrade. Also, the limits to sharing and forwarding messages are horrible. Edit: Also, similar to Instagram, their features are so full of bugs that it seems only interns work on them. Restoring the chat history on another phone always fails after getting to 97%. Lost an entire day trying it.",2025-03-02 20:22:47
Nils M,2,"The photos sent from this app keep saving on my gallery. It's a nuisance. I have to keep manually deleting them. To add to this nuisance, the app keeps asking about saving to Google drive or something else. Why not save in a temporary app folder like most apps do? Or at least make that an option... I literally loathe opening this app, and I loathe getting memes. I use the app cuz some family and friends overseas are on it, I wish they were on some of the other better communications apps.",2025-01-29 15:54:50
Anthony Thornton,1,"Whatsapp pushed some update making a lot of phones incompatible with the app. Can no longer add contacts, sync contacts, scan contacts with QR codes, or provide QR codes. Trying to get live support is impossible and the chatbot support just runs you around in a circle and won't escalate help. Also, sometimes will get disconnected and de-registered and will have to make new account.",2025-03-16 06:24:02
Leanne Brereton,1,"Stop messing with this app. Changing things around every 5 minutes and every time you do it goes worse. Can't access my full SD Card now. Only recents, camera, screenshots and downloads are available. I want access to ALL my photos and folders not just the ones you recommend. Click on see more and it brings up the exact same folders so how is this ""more""? Also keeps crashing and booting me out half way through typing. Started doing it last few days since someone started messing around again.",2025-02-06 14:30:31
Lucius I.,1,"Beware! Please read! I recently noticed pictures that I did not download on my phone- lots. I thought that maybe I had synced my account with my daughter's. Nope. So I researched it. Turns out apps can download stuff onto your phone. WhatsApp has been not only downloading pictures to my phone but accessing my contacts, my music and audio, and my phone calls in the last 24 hours. I have to use this app for school or I would delete it but I have revoked all permissions.",2025-03-02 11:49:23
Sandy bind,3,"For what I use it for at work, the app works fine. But when I had a problem with my number being banned after I tried to move it to a new phone, I got no response from Whatsapp. So gave up and adjusted at work. But on a whim I tried to download the app again after a month and a half...and it downloaded and works just fine. So...the app is fine as long as you don't have a problem! And just maybe, if you give it time, your account will reset.",2025-03-05 19:17:13
Tori McDowell,1,"If I could give WhatsApp zero stars, I would. The app is full of issues that never get fixed. It crashes constantly, the notifications don’t work properly, and messages often don’t send or arrive late. The interface is clunky, and it’s impossible to find old chats easily. Group chats are a nightmare with endless spam, and you can't even mute certain contacts without them still showing up.",2025-01-19 04:15:18

A Google user,2,I've been a staunch supporter of WhatsApp for many years but since one of the latest updates when I try to take a picture and zoom in to the max it automatically switches to that dreaded video note. I can't understand the point of it anyway. When I want to shoot a video I use the normal one. Why do I need that silly little circle but most to the point why does it switch to that when I'm just trying to take a closeup picture? Until you fix it I'm only giving you 2 stars 🙄,2025-02-06 03:18:10
Lisa Tibbitts,3,I have enjoyed using this app but I want the option to delete anything I've shared for everyone whenever the need arises. I am using it to get to know possible romantic partners but after talking and sending videos and photos (nothing r rated) I don't want them having access once we stop talking. That seems reasonable to me. Even harmless photos and videos can be misused when things are complicated and end.,2025-02-02 19:32:28

It would be so great if it could be used as the default sms/text app for my phone and I could send and receive messages from anyone whether they had WhatsApp or not.",2025-01-22 02:57:19
Jessica Clark,1,I used to use this app almost exclusively for messaging however after the latest update it has become intensely frustrating to use and is very glitchy. Voice to text is almost useless now and trying to edit a dictated message isn't possible. It simply highlights 1 word and does not allow anything to be done after that until it closes out the message and makes you start completely over. Hopefully they fix it eventually.,2025-01-23 17:38:53
Ilovelosangeles,1,"The LAST SEEN is not working for the past week! It even shows the wrong date & time for myself. I've uninstalled/reinstalled. I looked for updates; I'm using the latest version. I restarted my phone several times. Also, my phone is new, Android 14. This app started this issue last week. Until then, there were no issues.

Joy Rose,1,"The new update has made it a frustrating process to try to upload videos or pictures, even finding the albums has been made more difficult. The edit and autocorrect features for text are very buggy, as well as voice messages or even phone calls. Not to mention all the spam groups I get added to and the spam calls I get. It just seems to get worse over time when this could just be a simple messaging app.",2025-01-15 03:28:17
Varun Setlur,1,"On my Pixel 9 pro running Android 15, calls get muted when switching apps or locking the screen. The other party cannot hear until I switch focus back to WhatsApp. This makes it nearly impossible to use my phone for multitasking during long calls.

Lavendeer 201,3,"Custom stickers are a pain, gifs need to continue playing, and the latest update is awful for photos! I used to be able to see all my albums, but now I can only select from Downloads, Camera, Screenshots, and other preselected albums. This makes it VERY DIFFICULT to find the things I want to send to friends and family. Additionally, the typing and correcting spelling is very glitchy/frustrating now. Besides that, it's great for communication without cell service, and is much better than SMS!",2024-12-28 16:54:13
Bobbie Cole,2,"Finally found the hidden list bar at the top. I found that I had to swipe down in order to see it. Why is it hidden in the first place?

James Brown,4,"Almost perfect chat app. The pros: integration with existing contacts list. Breadth of options for messaging (voice, video, call, text, gift, emoji plus reactions).

Ricardo García Fernández,2,"The app works great overall. However, it has some relatively small issues which tend to be very annoying. When listening to a voice note while my ear is on the phone, the screen goes to black immediately as expected. However, it goes back to be active after a bit even when still listening to the note. This causes the audio to stop and the UI to be reactive to the touch of my ear. I've experienced this issue for a while now. Looks like the screen gets back to active after 30 seconds.",2024-11-01 20:28:29

Sony Nicolson,3,"Messaging is fast and reliable. However it does crunch the media quality, even when selecting the HD option. Also, getting any sort of calls when the app is not open is an absolute nightmare. It doesn't snooze when pressing the sound buttons and if the screen is locked it's very annoying to try to navigate to the calling screen to swipe up the Respond With Text option.

I tried contacting whatsapp multiple times, and their feedback was useless. I got auto messages about how to adjust my settings, which clearly I know how to do, but it's NOT WORKING.

I wish there was a way to have themes created for the app, that could be installed and have custom themes built. Like for example, Samsung phones, have themes that you can download. This allows you to custimze the theme make it more personable, rather than always having the same old green bubble. It just looks sooo outdated",2024-10-23 06:38:01

Groups can have people from many backgrounds. I've seen Polish, German, Spanish, Mandarin, French, Belarusian, Finninsh, etc. in some of the groups I'm in.

Maumant de Hoseillos,1,"What a disappointing frustration it has, that update after update this app undergoes no positive improvement. It has remained basically as rudimentary as it has been for quite a long time. Had it enjoyed a cloud-based platform, had it granted better capabilities in bilateral deletion/edition of messages, had it concealed the phone numbers/other privacies of the users, had it provided them with more options ( polls, streams, ability to record chat calls etc.) it could even outcompete all others",2024-11-13 14:39:58

What was simple, like adding pictures, is now a complex annoyance as editing them and the text added to them has been made more difficult, and the functionality is simply annoying.

Danish Siddique,1,"Hello, the latest WhatsApp update has introduced changes that I find quite inconvenient. Earlier, status updates were displayed in a straightforward vertical list, which I preferred. Now, they’re arranged in a horizontal format, which feels less user-friendly. Additionally, the Updates tab is now filled with channels and their options, which I don’t find useful. The previous design was simpler and more practical. I hope WhatsApp reconsiders and brings back the older layout. Thanks",2024-12-02 17:58:36
Danish Syah,2,"Emoji button is gone from the text status option. Why is that this app's update always makes it worse than before. I get that you did make an improvement (unnoticeable as always), but the things that has been removed or changed not to the users liking always sticks out the most. And one more thing. The web version should at least make text status. People who works 24/7 on their PC might need to use that anyway. And now somehow my contact isn't linked to this app",2025-01-20 14:19:26
Sidra Siddique,2,"From my point of view, WhatsApp is a fantastic messaging app that makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family.

An edit option for the status update. This will make updating status more user friendly and lessen the burden of deleting in situations where there's an oversight. 2. There should be validation error in times you exceed the character limit while typing a text status update so I don't see a shorter text after hitting send without notice.",2025-02-23 08:03:07
Bee A Unicorn,3,"It's a great app and all, I use it for my primary communication...but I must say the audio quality is trash, when I upload a picture or video on my status, the quality is trash and the video call quality is also trash. Also, notifications of new messages are inconsistent and sometimes show up 5 minutes after the contact has sent the message. Nevertheless, it's my primary messaging app and I wish the media quality was tip-top, otherwise the app is great.",2025-02-05 20:52:25
Nicholls9uk,4,"Great app but.......it used to work perfectly until bought a new phone last November. Since then an intermittent fault keeps happening. I type a message and press send and it disappears and hasn't been delivered. I then have to close the app and retry again. Sometimes even that doesn't solve the issue and I have to reboot the phone. I also have an issue with whatsapp calling, I'm not getting notifications that someone is calling and if I try to ring, it shows as though it's connecting but not.",2025-02-17 11:46:28
Marvellous Chukwukelu,1,"You guys made a feature that allowed me to have the account for two numbers. When I switched so that I could have it on the same phone, you erased the entire history for a number I have had for years. Your automatic backup doesn't work. I have to keep doing it manually. You don't send notifications for both accounts. No matter how many times I change the settings, you always stop sending the notifications for one of them and I don't realize that I am missing messages en masse. I hate this app.",2025-01-24 21:22:55
Xypleth,1,"Color space management/conversion is horrible. Turns shared images green, shifts/desaturates color. Only in this app, when sharing photos that are captured with Samsung default settings, they get badly converted to a different color space and/or don't include ICC profile, and they show up with wrong colors. This is an ongoing issue I've experienced ever since owning phone for half a year, tested another Samsung phone, same issue.",2025-02-08 22:57:02
Olamilekan Ayinla (Olami),5,"WhatsApp is hands down the best messaging app out there!

Whether for personal or business use, it’s the go-to app for staying connected.",2025-02-03 05:16:50
Ankit Bilolikar,5,A very good messenger. All you features are excellent. Recently added privacy point that no one can take a screenshot of profile photo is just great like you always say 'end to end encrypted'. According to me I think that you want to add a one more feature that shows the list of peoples from contact who seen our profile photo. It should be come out over rolling days. I really hope you add this feature as soon as possible. Anyway yours application is the best ever.,2025-02-25 05:34:38
Nicole Ashby,1,"Worst support ever. Can't even open the app without it crashing. Tried to use the ""Help"" option and if you want to have an actual person try to look at your issue, forget about it. Same responses constantly and no update, just AI computer responses. 3 days now and nothing has changed. Still a nightmare, into the 4th day. Uninstall whatever update effects A71 samsung phones",2025-02-27 17:21:17
Saad Abdullah,5,"WhatsApp Messenger 5/5 stars. WhatsApp is an exceptional messaging app that has revolutionized the way we communicate.

Noman Akhtar,5,"Dear what's app. Previously, when sending a video during a conversation, the process was quick and seamless: selecting a video from the gallery would immediately prepare it for sending. However, with the latest update, an additional step has been introduced. After selecting the video, I now have to click on the thumbnail in the bottom corner to confirm before it’s ready to send. This change interrupts the natural flow of conversations, especially when sharing videos quickly. Thank U",2025-01-28 21:21:31
Abdul Rehman,5,Incoming calls are not turning on the screen and showing the promt the deny or answer the call. I can hear the ringtone and have to unlock the phone to deny or accept the call. 1. I have tried reinstalling WhatsApp. 2. Verifying that my notifications settlings are correct. 3. I have tried to restart my phone but the issue still presits. 4. I have tested on a similar device as the issue also occors on it as well. 5. I am using Android 14. 6. All battery saving settings are disabled.,2025-03-14 01:02:16
Kunal Verma,1,"WhatsApp used to be a private space for real conversations. Now it’s filled with unsolicited messages from businesses I never subscribed to. Every day feels like spam overload. Features like “Channels” only add more clutter. It’s turning into a junkyard of unwanted content. If WhatsApp continues down this path, it risks losing the trust and loyalty of its users. Bring back the simplicity and privacy we signed up for.",2025-03-29 09:33:00
Facu Pudenti,3,"a few things: first there should be an option to disable backup of gifs. Second, statuses are very confusing for older people.

Vidhya Patel,3,"I think whatsapp should improve the video quality in status , the video quality gets very poor and blurry after posting it on the status . and sometimes the picture quality in video call also gets very poor .. it cause a lot of irritation to me ... but it has very good features also , like meta it solves a lot of problems in very less time and respond very quickly.. overall it is a good app for communicating",2025-03-27 06:56:25

John Sullivan,4,"Every update brings improvements but also new bugs downgrades. When attaching gallery the new proprietary-ish UI fails to offer Browse and Search the older one had those.

Janet Mustapha-Esteve,1,"For over or about 6 months now, my WhatsApp messenger has been frustrating me. My phone hangs each time I open the WhatsApp. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. I had even wiped off the data on it. It's still doing the same. At first, I thought it was my phone storage, and I kept on deleting files on my phone. It's still the same thing. If the fault was from my phone, it would affect my WhatsApp business, too. I just uninstalled it now and am currently downloading it now.",2025-03-08 13:17:04

Charlie P,1,"After the recent update if I want to attach a picture to a message. It's 100 times more difficult. I have lots of albums in my phone. When I select the paperclip icon as usual in WhatsApp to attach a picture, I then select ""gallery"" as normal. It then shows ""recent"" photos first, which is normal. At that point, I always tap the down arrow to find the album I want with the picture in it I want to attach but, apart from recents, WhatsApp now only lets me select from 4 albums in my phone !!",2025-02-01 22:51:02
Haeyeoung Akiyama,1,"I'm so tired to have this 'video freezing' it's really annoying. When I send a 10 second video, it adds extra time to the video and freeze.

I want another update but REALLY fixed, because IT'S REALLY ANNOYING!!!",2025-02-01 23:57:57
Abdulai Sumaila,3,"Overall ,whatsapp has been good since I started using it . But one problem I have with the app is that it reduces the quality of my pictures and videos whenever I send to someone or update my status. That piece of thing really gets me pissed. I own my data bundle and want to send an image, why not consume it and send the pictures as it is? they deserve a 5star rating, but only if the problem is fixed .",2025-03-23 10:20:48
Mthuli,1,What is the point of making us backup(backing up) our chats when upon getting a new device the application tells us failed to restore messages but is ever quick to restore media. I've over the years failed to find the then signicance of that feature and always being asked to select back up schedule when it clearly fails to restore afterwards. I'm honestly disappointed by this.,2025-03-23 10:40:17
Kiran Tondey,5,"This app is so well built that I never experienced a crash. The calls and video calls are so good. Just one feature I always wanted was that If you connected a linked device, The main device should have a option to only allow certain contacts, groups and communities that the user selected for the linked device. I hope that the team listens to my opinion. Still this app deserves 5 stars!",2025-03-27 09:27:47
Kanika Kapoor,1,"the latest WhatsApp update has introduced changes that I find quite inconvenient. Earlier, status updates were displayed in a straightforward vertical list, which I preferred. Now, they're arranged in a horizontal format, which feels less user-friendly. Additionally, the Updates tab is now filled with channels and their options, which I don't find useful. The previous design was simpler and more practical. I hope WhatsApp reconsiders and brings back the older layout. Thanks",2025-03-13 07:38:22
Joe,3,"I played around with the background options once when it popped up to show me the feature and now my background on video call is forever stuck on a fake background will not let me change it most the time you can't even see me on the call either.

Syed Numan,1,"I am writing to report a severe issue I encountered while using the multi-account feature on WhatsApp. After deleting a secondary account from the app, I discovered that media files (photos and videos) from my primary and active account are now missing.

Immediately after deletion, I found that media files from my primary account were no longer accessible",2025-03-26 21:12:44
Alan Watson,4,"Very useful, but suddenly cluttered with a ""Meta AI"" icon with no visible way of getting rid of it (I have deleted the chat, but the icon is still there, and there seems to be nothing in the settings to turn it off).

Goo Tioli,3,"The last update, adding the ai assistant, it would be great if the user could choose where to put the icon.

Sabreen Sayed,1,"Holds your media access permission hostage if you want to share an image, when you actually don't need it when sharing with an app from outside.

Sangpuii Sailo,2,"Just downloaded it on my new phone and the app keeps on glitching, this never happened before.

GalaxyMaker,1,"new updates are very buggy like all the other reviews say. When trying to send a photo, instead of the albums showing first, ""recents"" do and it takes longer to send a pic. Also the worst thing about trying to send single or multiple photos to people is the selector, when you scroll down it's fine, but when you scroll back up (to say select another you missed) it ALWAYS swipes the photo selector off and every photo you have selected has gone and you have to reopen and re-select the photos!!",2025-03-21 09:25:50

Victoria,1,"Editing a message has become so annoying. For example, if I want to capitalize a letter in a word I've already typed, I used to be able to just tap before the letter, delete it, and retype the capitalized version. But now, thanks to WhatsApp's update, it forces me to select the entire word/phrase. That means I have to delete the whole thing and retype it just to change one letter. Why make something simple so complicated!?",2025-02-09 09:01:48

A Google user,2,I liked how it was back then when I could know when the person i'am chatting sees my message and the confirmation lighting appeared when the online person is reviewing my messages. This is a fallback from knowing that the other contact has seen my messages. Before it would turn blue meaning the message was seen or heard now it just stays gray not letting me know if they have seen my messages. Please fix this fallback please. Hopefully this will be addressed soon. Thanks for your understanding.,2025-03-22 03:53:05

It's amazing - it didn't work 18 months ago, it didn't work a year before that. Surely they must have been able to fix it in that time. The answer is they can't want to fix it. I don't know why, maybe some way of forcing you to upload everything about you and your friends to their server. If they wanted to fix this they could, would have done it years ago. They are NEVER going to fix this.",2025-03-03 01:30:27

I guess it's more convenient when you are 100% sure what you want to send, but who is all the time? Also we can't listen to voice messages with leaving the app anymore? Bummer.",2025-01-09 11:32:38
Joseph Matane,1,"Enhance the calling experience by introducing distinct dial and ringing tones. Currently, the same 'calling' sound is used for both stages, making it difficult to differentiate between them. Consider incorporating nostalgic elements, such as the classic dial tone for the 'calling' stage, and a modern ringtone for the 'ringing' stage.

On the status screen, I can't find the emoji button, I have to use the emojis in my phone's keyboard. Still on status, when I dig deep to pick a picture to post, it doesn't appear for posting. I don't know if most of these updates are necessary, because when it's done, there are very little adjustments made and some functional features will be taken away.

Well done 👏 Please make it POSSIBLE for an administrator to be able to add contact numbers to groups without saving the number to their contact list first. It's crazy sometimes!

Fathima Khan,1,"I swear this app is getting worse by the day. Why can we no longer screenshot profiles? If it's for security purposes, people should be able to screenshot profiles, especially those they find suspicious. There are plenty of scammers using WhatsApp as their main medium. Also, we should be able to toggle read receipts on/off on groups because people are mainly using this app for work/neighborhood groups, and it's hella annoying. The sharing of images is also disastrous after the last few updates.",2025-01-30 19:09:24

This particular issue also persisted with my other account until whatsapp couldn't register it again. I have pleaded for a permanent solution each time I am logged out all to no avail. I want to believe there are no humans reading our complaints or addressing issues. They are just programed.,2025-02-25 10:58:52

Yasir Arafat,3,the stupidest thing in WhatsApp for me is archived messages. What's the point of archiving if it's in your face all the time? I preferred it better when the archive used to be at the bottom but now they have it at the very top where you can clearly see if you have a new message in the archive chat which will make you check it out therefore not archiving at all.,2025-02-08 18:59:49

Asad Rasool Qamar,5,WhatsApp is a great free communication app. But there should be one feature that is missing in the app. In my opinion there there should be a option to add audio song on WhatsApp status 😀,2025-03-20 15:13:40
James D,1,Well it is just was going to happen sooner or later. The annoying meta ai has dropped and it's in way and I keep accidentally pressing it. There is no way to turn it off. 😡,2025-03-29 22:48:09
Shrihari Prasad,3,Recently I'm unable to answer call in the background or lock the screen while calling as the receiver can't hear anything. This issue is being discussed in almost all the forums but there is absolutely no reply or patch from WhatsApp it's just radio silence. Please resolve the issue,2025-02-03 14:17:30
Selma Sumane,3,"I think it's nice, but the biggest issue is the videos. You can't share longer videos than 5 min?? That's ridiculous. Also, when the video is too long, I shorten it, but when I send it, it doesn't do anything, just shows retry. Please do something about this. But everything else is ok. I like that you can add filters on video calls and can speed up the voice messages. Maybe you could make a slow version too?",2024-12-14 16:42:41
Y2k Kaeli,3,"I highly recommend this app for communicating with friends and family. Its features, such as screen sharing and customizable status updates, enhance the user experience.

Naveed Kamal,3,"I've been using WhatsApp for years now, and it's definitely been a game-changer for keeping in touch with friends and family abroad.

Ayomide Ogunrinde,4,"Lately, the number of improvements is impressive but still a few adjustments and it'd be all good.

jinu william,4,"WhatsApp is a great app, but there are a few areas that could be improved. When transferring chats to a new phone, documents often cannot be downloaded, displaying a message saying, ""The document cannot be downloaded. Please ask the sender to resend it.""

Timothy Siebritz,3,"For the most part, WhatsApp works really well and is part of my day-to-day life. In two places, though, I find it has a limitation. One being the inability to send voicenotes using Android Auto. Speech-to-Text replies seldom work out well. Secondly, when connected to a Bluetooth headset, the headset mic is not used to record voicenotes. I tried this while wearing my motorcycle helmet, and it did not work. WhatsApp calls using the headset work well, but it does not record voicenotes.",2024-11-27 06:18:50
Aleksandr Chizhov,1,"Really tired of the way video circles work. When someone sends you like 10 in a row, the chat scrolls automatically and closes the circle you've been watching. And you gotta start watching from the beginning, because there is no functionality to fast forward it. That's getting more and more annoying. Also since channels were introduced a lot of spam came with it, casinos, dating, commercials. Changing to one star, impossible to use video circles, too many problems with it..",2024-11-21 16:47:38
Ali haider Mughul,2,"I would not recommend WhatsApp to be used for businesses. However it is very helpful for individual usage. It delivers quick, timely, functional, and consistent communication between any two individuals over half decent Wi-Fi. It has its kinks to it, like kicking you off once you start running low on storage, or automatically downloading the photos of friends when you forgot to unselect that option. But over all it is a great program to use! I am very satisfied whatsapp messenger",2024-10-22 22:11:14
Ludovico Ausiello,1,"The second last update was interesting, with a different order and look for the ikons of the extra attachments. The very last update though is much more complicated to use, especially when trying to upload images. Browsing through folders and selecting more than one image at a time is not as simple and intuitive as before. Such changes make the user feel like a Guinea pig, being put under test arbitrarily. Poor product design and even worst implementation.",2024-11-03 13:28:50
Ria Suman,1,"I'm giving this a 1-star rating due to a recent update that has made flipping the camera unnecessarily difficult. Now, users have to zoom in on the tiny selfie camera icon and then click it to flip, which is frustrating. For older users like my parents—and many others—finding and using these small icons can be challenging. The previous, more accessible design was much more user-friendly, especially for those who struggle with fine details. This feature change has made things harder for many.",2024-11-12 13:04:38
shook,2,"This has been my main platform for communication via friends, family and work. But the updates have become incredibly frustrating to work around, and at times, unreliable. You either get your message notifications delayed, get a notification that says 'you have a new message' (to which you can't view said message on the notification bar), or just straight up not get it at all. Sending videos become harder and quality degrades. All the simplicity, are made complex, and time consuming to remember.",2024-11-11 16:16:36
André Luís,4,"Great app. It'd be great if stickers were sent by sliding them into the chat instead of just clicking on them... I've accidentally sent stickers in the past to places I really shouldn't have. Also, what if the user could rearrange their stickers? Like into folders of our choice? The way it is now, it's arranged in folders, yes, but it's more the ""source"" foulders. I wanna download/create stickers and then be able to move them into folders that I made.

Ниссолино,3,"The app is fine except for two big problems: The first one is that when I try to send a voice message to myself it often just doesn't work. The second even bigger problem is that if I send voice recordings to myself from my phone storage, when I reinstall the app after backing up all the media it just doesn't save them saying something like ""they don't exist anymore"". The app can save these recording only if I don't reinstall it and it's very disappointing.",2024-11-16 11:02:39
A.A. N,4,WhatsApp has always been an exceptionally good app. I've not had any challenges until recently when I changed handsets and my backup was not able to restore.

This is my correct email thank you 😊,2024-11-06 10:39:25
Nelz,1,"This app seems to have a bug in it or something. It's not doing file attachments, which is really annoying. Emoji's can still be attached, but files are a no-no. This has been confirmed by others, and it needs to be rectified as soon as possible as it's something that is relied on.m A similar thing is happening.

Chimz,2,"Functional but not user friendly and compared to similar apps it lacks a lot of features. A big problem is that it claims to keep your privacy by encrypting chat messages, and yet at the same time if you are added to any group, your phone number is visible to everyone to save, spam and use. It's an app that started good but never really grew past a certain and point. Would not recommend.",2024-12-12 05:28:57
Lea Guepjop,2,"I've had good experience overall since I started using it. However right now it's seriously bugging. It takes excess time (more than 10mins) for my messages to be sent or to receive messages.

Ally vdM,3,"Cool recent update, but when clicking file attachment icon, the order in which you've placed the options doesn't make sense.

As well as having terrible overall performance and frequent ""freezes"" (especially contact search, to the limit that is faster to scroll through chats' history than to use the search feature).

Not to forget various aggressive data collection and privacy concerns.",2024-11-09 07:29:02

Again, the status content sometimes goes muted by itself when one clicks it and will only play audio, if such happens, after one uses one's phone's volume button. Updating the application didn't solve it.",2024-12-09 06:25:55
Mahmoud Wael,1,"1- When playing a voice note, it stops after 28 seconds or a similar interval. THIS IS ABSURD ! I want to hear the entire note without interruptions. Instead, it stops, forcing me to replay it repeatedly. 2- When I write a list starting with a hyphen (-), like this: - one - two WhatsApp automatically changes it into a dotted list with a fixed space. THIS IS VERY RIDICULOUS TOO ! There should be an option to choose this formatting, not to be forced into it. Both issues are extremely annoying !",2024-10-09 16:31:24

This feature need to be done very fast because once you make a mistake in the text, you have no option than to delete the status update.

It would definitely make the experience more enjoyable and dynamic Overall, WhatsApp is still a solid choice for messaging 😉",2024-12-19 14:33:46
Jose D.,1,"When it comes to backup, Meta Whatsapp demostrate a VERY low level of engineering development. The experience is frustrating to say the least when switching to a new phone. I don't have the time to figure it out. The process must be robust and put the client's data ahead of anything else. But it doesn't. I lost all my chats because trying to restore, it created instead an empty chats backup on top of the older one and deleted the previous one. Very stupid logic, very poor process. Not good !!!!",2024-11-12 00:22:20
Tsau Kenneth,3,"It used to be simple and easy to use. But now the new status layout is ugly. It's also having glitches where once I try to view a status, it does not show in full screen. It only appears at the centre until I close and relaunch the app. It also closes at times when I launch and place my finger print. Miss the original whatsapp 😥 Simple and straight forward. Only things I like with this one: I can view muted statuses individually without worry that it will open the next one automatically. S21",2024-12-12 19:35:32
Alain DELANAY,1,"I've been using this app for years without main issues. For instance, I could take a video with my camera and send it to someone easily. After a recent update, maybe the last on 18/11, it started to fail: I send the video and the receiver can't watch it because blurry. Also on my own WhatsApp it becomes blurry after sending. I identified that the compression by WhatsApp when sending is the cause. This message here because the WhatsApp support refuse to even consider my case.",2024-11-22 05:28:11
Winston Mwamande,4,"I love the text 'edit' feature after you send a text. So here is an idea, instead of long pressing the specific text... Why not just allowing a person to tap the text 4 times. Like how when you want to tag a message, you just swipe the text bar right. Also, this new update is taking way longer to upload a media file when sending it.",2024-12-14 13:17:01
reas kharmy,1,Since 3 years already that I use this app I fail to notice an upgrade in pictures and video quality when it is sent. The HD mode is basically useless because there's no much change. The picture and videos to be sent can look great in your phone but once sent the qualities are degraded it's so horrible. I heard it to save space but I think they should make it an option so that the user should choose whether or not they want an uglier version of their photos and videos in the name of space saving!,2024-10-28 11:11:11
Claudia Gagnon,1,"I have done everything possible in the last 24hrs to get this app to work on my Pixel 7 but I can't get past the profile screen. After trying to initialize, it tells me that a connection is not possible. I've rebooted my internet, my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, contacted my service provider (apparently it's not them, it's the app). I followed every troubleshooting item the app listed on their Help page. I sent an email for help, but reply just directed me back to their help page.",2024-11-02 22:36:01
Stephanie Rassolenko,4,"Good, except I had to reload all the app data and do so much when I changed from iphone to Samsung. Also I wish I could use whatsapp on multiple devices, because usually it logs out if there's more than one. And finally, updates keep changing the colour of certain buttons from green to blue and to green again all the time, the designers seem to have trouble deciding which one looks better😆. I think all green interface is the best.",2024-10-29 14:47:06
Mirza Mughal,3,"This is indeed a good app to communicate with your friends and loved ones. By every update it's becoming more amazing. But I think there should be some changes. Firstly there should be an option to communicate anyone in case of emergency, we have no internet connection. Second thing is that we have to change audio of status so]there should be an option to add audio",2024-11-08 20:56:07
Brenda Kiconco Nsubuga,3,"Dear WhatsApp, Kindly adjust your status algorithm. Just because I replied to someone's status once or twice doesn't mean I want them appearing at the top of my list. Same applies to personal chats, just because I communicated with someone for one or two days doesn't mean they are a favourite person or important. It'd be nice if the status has a favourite list that can easily be changed by us or prioritise statuses from conversations that span a month or more, or go back to factory settings. Thx",2024-10-28 17:16:27
Valerie Trinder,1,"This has totally messed up my phone, since the upgrade I can no longer send videos through whats app, constant video capture failed messages, random black screens and in general just not behaving as it did right before the update. Tried multiple ""fixes"" still not functioning, really disappointed, thanks for that, rather than ""bug"" fixes, you gave me one.",2024-11-20 14:59:35
Munia Nawshin,2,"What's with the new update? Sending pictures and videos interface has changed. And it's not good honestly. The previous one was better. Change it to the previous one. It's worst that only 4 or 5 folders are showing and if you want to enter on another folder you need to go to the phone/sd card directory . And the Video calls,screen sharing sucks. After like 15 to 20 minutes the shared screen gets blurry..",2024-11-02 06:16:11
Imkongkumzük,4,"WhatsApp is an amazing media platform, easily accessible to all and really convenient. However, it has to undergo updates after every certain period of time and after every update I find it a bit confusing and also, the old features (that I was pretty much aware of) are changed too. I'd suggest that these things should be made simpler as WhatsApp as a medium used by people of all age groups.",2024-11-09 05:35:09
Rashneet,3,"WhatsApp is definitely a really good application for texting and now it's almost similar to Instagram and I love all the features, but I've been facing an issue continuously. I'm trying to send a video and the first few seconds of the video are being cut automatically and then the other half is sent! I find this pretty annoying. I'm looking forward towards some solution for my problem. Thank you!",2024-11-28 04:27:59
Somesh,1,"I noticed a few bugs recently that spoil the user experience. 1. When I edit a message and exit the chat, I still see the old version of the message instead of the updated one. 2. Sometimes after sending a message and leaving the chat, the other user's reply appears as the last message instead of mine. However, when I reopen the chat, my message is displayed as the most recent one, which is a significant bug.",2024-12-18 16:25:19
Ashok Jhawar,4,"Recently the emoji tab at the time of writing in status has been removed. It was very helpful. Secondly, the status is the only verticle, where not so much improvement took place. We can't reduce or increase the size of fonts on our own, the type of fonts are very limited, the colour of fonts is also single i e. White only. All these should be taken care of.",2024-12-14 03:02:55
Shamal Chail,1,"Hi, I’ve noticed some changes with the recent WhatsApp update, and I’m finding it quite frustrating. Previously, I preferred seeing only status updates in a simple, vertical format. I don’t have any interest in seeing channels or their settings cluttering up the Updates tab. However, with the new update, the status updates have been shifted to a horizontal layout, which feels less intuitive and inconvenient for me. It’s quite disappointing, as I was comfortable with the previous setup where ever",2024-11-12 14:30:44
TALAT ABBAS,5,"The meta AI is just too good. It helps me in completing all my school projects and is creative as well but it has an extremely weak memory and makes mistakes some times, it remembers nothing if you'll send it multiple messages, it will remember only the last 1 or 2 messages. But yeah, it's very good for making projects, especially the theoretical projects. And it is not reliable for asking formulas or any type of calculation. But overall it's very useful and much better than Google assistant.",2024-12-22 14:07:47
Umunnakwe Michael,3,"Hello, I noticed that after updating my WhatsApp, it started hanging and closing by itself. Also if I want to send a video or picture to someone, it takes time to even upload for preview and in most cases it will close and I will see a notification WhatsApp stopped working. All these were not happening until I updated the app. Kindly look into it and fix it.",2024-12-10 09:06:12
Manuel Simons,2,My animated stickers suddenly stopped moving. For a while now I noticed that each time it stops moving it is a sign that the app is due for an update and has been like that since this year. However this latest episode isn't about update as I have already checked twice and yet the stickers aren't animated. They are still like thumbnail pictures. I don't know why and it is distressing. Pls help,2024-10-23 09:22:28
Abdallah Ahmad,3,"I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S21+ and have noticed a bug with WhatsApp. Whenever I use the app, my phone freezes, and the screen becomes unresponsive. It only becomes responsive again after some time or if I press the power button to lock and unlock the phone. This issue only occurs with WhatsApp, as no other apps behave this way. I've tried clearing the cache, uninstalling, and reinstalling WhatsApp, but the problem persists. A friend of mine has experienced the same issue, so I'm unsure if this",2024-10-17 20:06:29
