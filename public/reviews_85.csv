Andrea K,5,"This review is mostly for the customer service. I had one teenie tiny issue going on with my app so I contacted the developer and was absolutely blown away. They were all over it instantly. Going through troubleshooting and everything that could possibly be bugging my app. after a couple days they finally found a fix and my app works flawlessly again. This has always been my go to for podcasts and after this experience, I will not use anything else.",2025-03-27 23:57:02
Jeffrey O'Brien,1,"The oee again. Nothing has changed in years. Now I can't even listen to a Playlist, it keeps reverting to a different one! Garbage. Navigating this disaster is the height of frustration. Terrible interface, buggy, everyday settings buried deep inside menus that make no sense. This service doesn't offer anything I can't get elsewhere, and no one else tortures me to use their interface. Uninstalled, again.",2025-03-15 20:24:04
Eden Valencia,5,"This is the best app ever!!!!!!! Stupid Amazon music blocks almost every song so you cant listen to it and if you get premium nothing changes, in fact they TEMPT you to buy EVEN MORE STUFF but spotifys not like that also I'm on a chrome iOS and Spotify works surprisingly well more than other apps do, although I think its only on my computer, I have to uninstall it then download to open it up. I also love a feature where you can block explicit songs so if you have any kids or you are a kid do it!",2025-03-20 16:27:31
Rheanon Adkins,1,"way more ads than music. playlist constantly closes, and you have to start over. constantly pauses for no reason. tells you 30 minutes ad free, which only crashes the ap or plays more ads. this app only gets worse with time. you can't even use it while driving because it forces you to open up the ap and physically look at the ads. dont waste your time. just go to youtube music if you want a good music app. after 10 years of use, i can happily say im uninstalling this archaic garbage.",2025-03-27 01:23:23
Teacup Appleblood,3,"Good interface, but... It'd be way better if Spotify on mobile devices was like Spotify on computers. Just look at how much more freedom you get on a computer when you listen to music in comparison with how limited the mobile version is! I don't know why it is the way it is (most likely marketing, but what isn't nowadays?)... Anyway, not really that good of an experience if you have Spotify Free but I still use it for some reason :/",2025-03-26 16:16:49
ryan pigeon,2,"Don't fall asleep with Spotify playing. it will start playing random bad podcasts, which will then forever be auto-played, with NO options to remove the unwanted programs from your lists or not play them. FIX THIS! ok app for music and podcasts, but the Adds are ridiculous! I Pay for premium to get away from the adds, but there is still 2 adds every 10 min, only now I can skip them... and you have to have signal to access downloaded songs/files, making it pointless to download them. frustrating",2025-03-21 13:41:04
William Detlefsen,2,"This app has become increasingly clunky and riddled with ads. After listening to a downloaded podcast and deleting it, Spotify keeps it in your queue, cluttering it up and making it harder to find podcasts you haven't listened to. When fast-forwarding past intros and ads, it will randomly put you back at the beginning. If you're looking for a podcast player, I'd recommend going elsewhere.",2025-03-20 11:50:06
Max Wen,1,"so many years and no updates to the UIX but more and more irrelevant ads. even when it says ""listen to this ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" it's a complete lie and I'll get another ad after 2 songs. sometimes I open the app and it will have a popular song of the time ready to play even though it doesn't match anything I've ever listened to, they are just trying to boost the play numbers for some artists. impossible to use this app and not see the scam this entire industry is.",2025-03-16 08:10:36
Davis Glazebrook,2,"The only thing consistent about Spotify is how frustrating it is. UX And UI change all the time from bad to bad, never gets better. Pay Artists More!! Stop with the limited audiobook credits, paid promotions on premium, and AI garbage like the dj. Let me find new music from artists I follow Instead of burying the releases menu that doesn't even show all of them!! I could write a book about how much I hate this app.",2025-03-12 00:25:46
Alecia Carle,1,"Just keeps getting WORSE while charging us MORE! Premium service sucks now. You can't add/delete/rearrange songs to the queue anymore. Takes an absolutely insane amount of time for playlists to load now. And it's constantly adding the same songs to the queue... And now there's no way to remove them. Bring back all the premium features and stop taking them away! And the free version is a joke, you use to get 3-4 songs after less than a min of ads, now it's 3-4 min of ads for a song... RIDICULOUS!",2025-03-25 15:24:36
Pyroshock,1,"When using the Free version of this app, searching and playing a song is broken. For example, if I search and play ""Billie Jean"" by MJ, it will play ""Beat it"" or ""Thriller"". Earlier versions of spotify did not do this and it makes this app one of the most unreliable apps for Free music playing - along with your procured playlists on permenant shuffle. You'd be better off with competitor products. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - unless you have over 100 dollars a year to blow on premium.",2025-03-09 14:48:02
Derek DeVries,2,"Subscribed to premium service and I've been nothing but disappointed. The audio quality is good and the catalog is large, but the UI is terrible and Spotify keeps interrupting me with ads/notifications for their other services/features. They prioritize podcasts over music and there's no way to provide feedback on what you're interested in (or not): I had to subscribe to some innocuous shows just to stop them from promoting Joe Rogan every time I opened the app to listen to music.",2025-03-21 19:09:44
Hellish Champion,1,started ok rapidly turning it's self into garbage. number of ads keeps increasing. I download to listen later so I don't waste data. they have data saving options like do not randomly play something when playback is over. I have that enabled and yet after every downloaded podcasts it starts playing hip hop. I have never listened to music on this app and can't get it to stop. do what every1 else does and use something else.,2025-03-27 18:06:25
Allen Edwards,3,"good music and interface but the auto switching between devices and the always running in the background of my phone is very annoying. I have disabled the ability to run in the background, force stopped the app and somehow when I am listening on my computer it will randomly switch to my phone. or randomly I will find the Spotify player in the device toolbar open and playing even though I never had the open open. Spotify is auto opening the app in the background without my permission.",2025-03-24 13:30:54
S Miller,5,"A slight hiccup is happening recently (January 2025... still there March 2025) - every time I open the app and click on any option, it shuts down. I can immediately reopen it and it works fine. But it seems to need to shut down at least once. I believe it's typically when I choose ""Your Library"", ""New Episodes"". Have used app for years and love it.",2025-03-20 11:04:48
Nemi Santos,1,"I used to loved this app, but now we have a lot of new issues rather than solutions. The new queue system sucks. Can't delete several songs at once. The new ""clear"" buttom only clears songs in the ""queue"" I DONT WANT TO DELETE EVERY SINGLE SONG INDIVIDUALLY! New closed captions on podcast are on the top, it's annoyin When Spotify is open on my PC and I change the volume on my phone, it only changes the volumen on my pc! This app gets worse by the minute and it's seems less worth each time!",2025-03-26 18:38:35
Tim Miller,1,Tried giving this app another chance. Still a no go. Frustrating that video function doesn't work when connected Bluetooth just because your in a moving vehicle whether your driving or not. This app is so awful and invasive! It will play by itself if you press play/pause on any other player app. TV version is even worse! So many missing functions and trying to simply find a certain Podcaster that that you've even already been listening to is a chore. Avoid at all costs. Not worth the agrivation.,2025-03-17 17:05:43
Heather cook,1,"Normally a huge fan. I have over 20000 liked songs, I make a new playlist weekly for work. It has a huge issue scrolling past the first 30 or so songs. Maybe it's time for them to break up the liked songs into two alphabetical groups of you have over a certain amount of saved songs. It's becoming impossible to do the 1 thing I really depend on the app for. Yes, I have already deleted it, cleared out the cache, redownloaded it. No avail.",2025-03-18 22:22:50
Fizz,4,"Still love the app, but I have to say that the UI change to the queue is so intensely frustrating to me. I enjoy that it shows the album covers, but please for the love of all that is holy, separate the things I added to the queue myself from the ""next in playlist"" section again. The way it looks now is super messy to me and really messes with the way I use it.",2025-03-15 05:26:16
Brynn Sisk,2,"I have premium, and i used to adore this app. however, for the past week or so, the app will just stop playing music after a couple of songs. I have to fully close and restart the app then restart the playlist, and then the process begins all over again. it's infuriating. update, 7/24/24: this still happens sometimes, but now the issue is the removal of songs from my liked playlist. doesnt matter if i liked them years or minutes prior to checking my liked songs, certain ones just wont show up :/",2025-03-24 21:29:00
Kimberly V,3,"This would be a 5 star app but all of this month I've been experiencing issues, specifically since March 10th, the latest update. I cannot go back to a previous song or restart a song! And this is a problem for me because I am the type of gal to return to a song when I feel like I'm not appreciating it enough. Also, on my PS5, my music will go on an ultimate loop of 1 advertisement until I restart the app. Please let me go back/rewind songs and fix my PS5's Spotify issue!",2025-03-19 19:52:25
Zaria D,3,"I've been using Spotify for years and I'll admit, it's the best music app you can use. But lately, my reset button hasn't been available and it's causing me trouble. I've tried resetting the playlists, nothing. Closing then reopening the app, nothing. I'm going to see if updating the app will help. Update 1: Still didn't work😓 Update 2: Even tried logging out, didn't work. Update 3: Even redownloaded the app, nothing. Update 4: Spotify, what happened!? Why is the whole app getting worse!?",2025-03-28 04:54:21
Brian Eyman,2,"I love this app. listen to podcasts every day. until today. it's doing nothing but cache. and causing high battery drain the second I open it. even after clearing cach. please fix devs. of Spotify!!! so i can resume listening. It's been great for many years till now. completely unusable now. after it's fixed, I'll update my rating.",2025-03-22 18:20:31
Nathan Telkamp,2,"Spotify keeps stopping media playback in all other apps whenever it is running in the background (not playing music, just being open). It's super frustrating. I have to force stop spotify any time I want to watch a YouTube video or listen to a Pandora station or anything, because it just repeatedly pauses whatever I'm trying to play. Samsung S22 Ultra. Please fix this. Edit: Yes, I have tried reinstalling. I still have the issue",2025-03-22 04:40:38
Chad,1,"Downloaded songs and shuffle ruin the app. I use the app a lot out of service area so I download plenty of music to listen to. When I try to listen to the downloaded music the app only plays rap and hip hop, plays the same 10 songs over and over again out of 2500 plus downloaded songs. It sometimes won't even play other songs I try to select outside the apps chosen favorites, I click on it and it does nothing. It ruins the whole experience of using the app.",2025-03-05 16:08:07
DeWitt Powers,2,"One step forward, two steps back. The updated queue is nice for swiping songs away, but now it sucks for removing multiple songs at once. It makes it easier to accidentally play the song instead of removing it too. The add to playlist function is broken now after the much needed multi-playlist update. Now if you hit the back button on your phone or in the app, it will clear all your playlists you've added so far and either start you over or close the add to playlist screen altogether. Annoying.",2025-03-05 19:55:06
Isabella Cila (BavenTheRaven),1,"Unusable without premium. They remove basic features and lock them behind premium for the mobile app. The desktop version is the only usable one, there too many ads otherwise and they keep changing the ui to absolute garbage. Last time I checked they removed the ability to loop just one song if it's in a playlist. Premium isn't even affordable, just a straight up cashgrab from a greedy company. Go use SoundCloud, At least they let you loop songs for free.",2025-03-05 19:18:03
Ivy,5,"Music is EVERYTHING. It makes me calm, relaxed, and just be in my little small world! I love how I get to do my playlist!! I would use this everywhere I go. In my car, my room, outside, in school, in stores, when I'm bored, when I feel happy/sad, I just love this so much and I'm being so fr! Literally all the songs one needs/knows. The same goes for the podcasts! EVERYTHING is on Spotify with entertaining playlists made by so many people! It is easy and fun to use!! Best app for music/podcasts!!",2025-03-17 03:40:19
Christina Porter,3,"Used to have a 2 star rating for the app in 2023, and major issues have been updated, but i still continue to have some issues with songs randomly pausing and not playing. The ads are also insane. 3 to 4 30 second ads in a row after only playing a few songs is very irritating to say the least. I don't have the money to be spending $12/mo for premium so it is what it is, but it gets annoying. Otherwise, app is pretty good for listening to music whenever, driving, walking, etc.",2025-02-06 10:02:08
Julian Eaddy,2,"The app works, but barely. It will throw ads at you every other song, and the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is 5-8 minutes at best. On top of that, basic features such as rewinding or skipping a song are lost behind the Premium Paywall (which gets more expensive every 3 months). You can't even pick which song you want to listen to on your playlist, as it's stuck in shuffle mode. It's glitchy. When I opened my phone, music started playing, and it jacked up my volume to max. I'm done. 👎",2025-02-21 18:03:08
Rachel S.,1,"Suddenly stopped working today. Anytime I go to my library, the app closes. If I even try to play a local file downloaded on my phone, it closes. I've been having a bug for many months where the app would close the first time I went to the ""New Episodes"" podcast playlist, but it was a minor annoyance. This is completely unusable. Frustrating that it happened the day after my monthly Premium charge happened! Hope it will be fixed soon.",2025-02-23 08:47:54
Miguel.,5,"On my device, it's awesome. I use this everyday, everywhere and always, for over 50,000 minutes. Other than the ads (which aren't too annoying once, again, on my device) it's pretty much perfect. I just don't enjoy how some songs are unavailable because of regions, but it's not a big issue since the mainstream is there as well as a lot of underground. There's not much to complain about, since I use the free version. So far, i say this is great.",2025-01-15 02:57:35
Spook Spook,1,"It's just ad after ad after another ad. The only pro is that virtually every artist is available, but even then, there are other services with that same variety and fewer ads. Even some features are locked behind a pay wall. I shouldn't have to spend $7+ a month just to turn off shuffle. Plus, their lyrics are broken and are often times faster or slower than the song.",2025-02-18 02:49:52
Cindie Dowell,2,"Why remove the ability to delete a song from the play queue? I don't understand why I pay for an app that tries to control everything I listen to. Isn't that the whole point of paying? That, plus the fake ""shuffle"" feature makes me hate Spotify. Again, if it's a playlist I made, I like all of the songs! I don't need Spotify to play 5% of them over and over for me and never play the other 95%. I suppose it's time to find a new music service.",2025-03-01 13:56:42
Lily W,4,"Spotify is a pretty decent music app. It more likely than not has any song you search for, and the design is simple and easy to work with. However, it does have some faults: the ads, and premium. I will get an ad that tells me that the next 30 minutes of listening will be ad free, then two songs later and I get four ads. It's impractical and misleading. There are some perks with Premium, but I should not have to pay to be able to skip songs freely. That's just kinda bogus.",2025-02-21 23:52:26
Brandy Lutz,1,"Can't look up an artist and see their album to add songs to my playlist. I have to look up each song. I also can't pick a song and listen because Spotify will only play a different song. You already get money from making me listen to ads. I'm on a limited income and can't afford to pay a monthly fee. Also, throwing in random songs on my playlist that I didn't add is not welcome. I want to hear my choices. This makes me not want to use Spotify at all. I'll find a better music app.",2025-02-01 01:54:29
Jo Batson,5,"I love using Spotify. However, I wish they would bring the option back to rearrange your Playlist via the mobile app, especially when you're paying for Premium Service. Having to login via the internet or computer is an inconvenience when you're paying for the service monthly you should be able to change the order of the songs via the app. **sigh** :-(",2025-02-09 02:35:31
Jamie Cagle,1,"App continuously just keeps pausing my music if I do literally anything else on my phone while using it. I have my playlist downloaded, as I use it for playing music over the speaker at work. I've tried clearing my downloads, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app,and nothing fixes it. I try to open up any other app or my browser and it hard stops the music. Does this while I'm driving as well. My phone has space and this is the only app giving me such recurring problems.",2025-02-03 16:33:25
Chili waffles,4,"Spotify is great. there’s a huge variety of music. I’ve only come across one thing I couldn’t find (A Groovy Thing, By Flamingosis). I really like making playlists and organizing them into folders. Premium is definitely worth it, no ads, unlimited skips, and downloading playlists. It’s also really easy to connect to a TV or gaming console. Spotify is better than other platforms, especially since the music keeps playing in the background.",2025-01-22 23:38:47
Annastacia Monroe,1,"Very unhappy with the video constantly playing on the home screen. It's irritating. For the longest time Spotify was the ONE app that didn't have jarring overstimulating videos in your face. Not anymore I guess. It makes me dread opening the app, especially because I used to use Spotify to relax from a hard day. I Just want music. There should be an option to remove the videos from the home screen. It's obvious that Spotify is trying to be the next Tik Tok or social media app.",2025-02-14 19:14:54
keith saylor,1,"TOOK AWAY THE LAST GOOD THING ABOUT SPOTIFY, the queue!! Used to be able to click queue and select random songs from library in the queue to play next, now you can't, have to individually drag each song to the top. Absolute trash. EVERY single update Spotify has done for the last 5 years has made the app worse and worse. Used to be the best, can't get my 7000 songs off the damn app without starting completely over on something else, no transfer apps work. So effing mad.",2025-01-17 00:11:53
Amber Desjarlais,5,"I've used this app for 13 years, and it's the best music app out of all of them. Highly recommend! Edit: Why did the ""search in your library"" feature changed. I really enjoyed searching an artist and having all of the songs I like come up instead of making individual playlists of all the artists. Now, it shuffles through my library playlist instead of the searched songs. It's a bummer!",2025-01-11 16:48:32
Dean Johnson,4,"Have always liked the app. But recently I've been having some issues. I use my ""liked songs"" playlist the most. About 2700 songs. And when I click on the song, it takes a hot second to play it. And if you click another, it will continue to play the original for at least 2 seconds before it changes. As well as if I scroll through the songs, pick one, switch to a different app, then come back, and it brings up songs that are higher in my list. Could just be me but idk.",2025-01-18 19:55:25
Erica Northup,3,"Used to be able to listen to it all day with no issues. Then, at the end of 2024, I'd get 20 minutes of music, and it gets stuck on an ad. I've looked into it numerous times and was told it's my wifi. My wifi is fine. It's the app. This needs to be fixed, or the apps are going to lose a lot of people to Pandora or YouTube. I've already started to make the switch. I'd love to stay with spotify. I like how the app works WHEN IT WORKS. But it doesn't anymore.",2025-02-20 13:24:56
Endless Abyss,1,"My music keeps stopping and wont unpause unless I open the app and unpause it. When I unpause it, it starts the song from the beginning.

I want to hear ALL OF THEM at some point.",2025-02-10 08:39:05
Mack,3,"It's okay. Queue has a lot of issues. The recent update makes it so you can't re-add or delete songs from the queue, you can't select multiple songs to delete or re-add them there, (and if you can, the option to is not clear) and even before that update when I'd try re-adding songs to my queue from it, it would jumble my order up and I'd have to manually rearrange it again, or sometimes put it into my ""next in playlist"" rather than ""queue"" section.",2025-02-17 08:59:34
Kyla Carlson,2,"For the past month now, the app has been very slow and when I go to my liked songs, it shows up as 7642 and then when I click into it says 7602 and all my other apps work fine not sure if it's because that's a lot of songs or not but there have been no updates and I've tried to re-download and it still won't work as well as check my storage, clear my cache, etc. It works fine on my computer so I have no idea how to fix this anymore but it's frustrating having it be like this.",2025-01-24 06:53:32

Caeser,1,Can you please fix this app? It's been half a year an shuffle play is still broken. Keeps playing the same 10 songs on a 500 song Playlist. The DJ is a useless feature. Half the time playing the same 10 songs and then random playing Spanish top hits and top ten American hits. It's been over year. I am about to cancel my subscription and find a new app. This is garbage.,2025-01-27 20:52:30
Melissa,1,I HATE the way the new update makes my queue look on mobile. I have premium and cannot remove songs from my queue or adjust anything with the queue as easy as I used to.

Additionally they have updated the queue function and it's terribly ugly and less useful than it used to be with the addition of 3 useless buttons at the bottom that hog up the screen.

The only thing that I would like them 2 improve is the lyrics and time sinking them. They r most likely 2 fix it if you report it, and when u do it takes like 1-2 weeks to be fixed. But this app does not only have music it has podcasts, a DJ that makes playlist for you, episodes of craters strate from YouTube and more",2025-02-08 03:46:16
Solange Roman,1,"Would you like a music app that can shuffle? Find a different one! Constantly adding new songs to playlist only to have the same 50 always play in the same pattern. Hit shuffle again? Nope, same. It's awful, it makes no sense and forces u to use their ai dj to actually mix it up. Updating to say it still cannot shuffle.",2025-02-27 09:50:47
Julie Stillman,3,"Great app to listen to music, but when I get the ""30 minutes ad free"" part, it's not 30 minutes it's just one song, maybe two before another ad pops up and sometimes its multiple ads in a row.

April Moon,5,"OK so only improvement I can really see at this point is with the podcast experience. I'd like it if when I select under Filter & Sort that it would stay with my selection instead of resetting to All Episodes vs that I'd like it to stay on Unplayed Episodes only every time I come back next day or whenever. but unfortunately i come back later to reset filters and end messing up on which episode I left off on. otherwise, my favorite for all audio Streaming enjoyment",2025-01-16 05:30:44
Tanz Afroz,2,"Good selection but needs a better UI like long press to select multiple songs/media. It is such a a pain that you can only move one song at a time in a playlist. When playing from an album or playlist, we need a button to start it over instead of playing from where it was left off. Swipe left to delete. The whole queue should be cleared with one press instead of clearing it twice. I don't know why the Spotify developers don't add these basic features!!",2025-02-21 06:42:15
Michael Nelson,1,"Honestly, just use any other app that provides music streaming. Loading up Spotify to see that my playlist of two thousand or more songs doesn't display properly and can't be edited is beyond frustrating. I spent years building a profile of music that I enjoy, just for the platform I made it on to completely nullify all my progress. Playlists change as the person who created them does; so, being able to edit them, let alone see the tracks in them, is pretty important.",2025-03-06 03:14:05
Elizabeth Sampson,2,"The quality, for the most part, is fine. But two things that have really irked me: first, and most importantly, IT HAS NO TRUE SHUFFLE. Unless that's ever changed, my rating will not go up. Second, if a friend shares a song link with me, clicking on it automatically plays the song and interrupts whatever playlist I may have had going instead of just taking me to the song info and giving me a choice to play it or not. Would be nice if it didn't do that.",2025-01-06 03:16:24
Hannah Soules,4,"I've used this app for several years. I don't pay for premium, and I've never really minded the ads. Sometimes it'll give you four ads back to back and then promise you 30 minutes of ad-free listening, only to play you an ad after the next couple of songs. That's super annoying and is why I docked a star. But it doesn't happen all the time. After the most recent update (Dec 2024?), it would only play one song and then stop completely. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it fixed the issue.",2025-01-05 22:28:03

WTH is going on with the app it keeps freezing up, stops playing after 1 song & I have to uninstall it and download it again EVERY SINGLE TIME for it to work???!!!! Please fix ASAP!!!

Evalyn Curran,4,"Spotify is a good app. But so far I have had a few issues. been using spotify for two years but these two weeks it has suddenly quit working. I can only play one song at a time before needing to go back, giving me an ad that doesn't work and freezes the app, closing the aapp, back on, and repeating. I don't fully know why it is doing this, and I have looked up how to fix it but only got advice for I-phones (I use android) I've restarted and deleted the app several times and it still won't work",2025-01-03 01:29:04

I'm on the premium plan, yet I'm still getting ads on podcasts and I don't have access to audio books. There are some podcasts that I used to listen to almost daily that have now become locked.

Mara* Ponce,4,"1. I want to listen to playlist folders on shuffle in the mobile app. It's dumb that we can do it on the desktop app but not mobile. 2. I want a bigger space to manage my playlists. I hate the tiny sidebar! I want to toggle between thumbnails and list-view in the primary windrow. 3. I want to be able to click on a track and see what playlists I have added it to, without first trying to add it to get the ""already on this playlist, add again?"" notice.

Alexis Jakubiak,2,"I've used Spotify premium for years and don't want to start over on a different service, but lately it's glitchy, the algorithm and shuffle are way too repetitive, and the app randomly clears my queue all the time. I mainly use it to play music in my car, and sometimes if I hit pause for just a few minutes, I return and it's cleared my whole queue. Sometimes it even resumes playing at first but then does this. App used to be amazing but functionality has decreased. Please fix!!!",2024-10-13 20:30:01
Alexis Gentile,2,"It plays music and you can use it with third party sites to check stats, that's about it for the positives. The random is far from random, when you finish listening to an album you get the same one or two songs that pop up every time, the daylists are stale and quickly become self-perpetuating, many bands are still missing songs and albums, new playlists are public by default, the whole thing is a mess and crashes often when i'm driving.

I've been listening to a podcast's library and it switched me to a curated list. If you want to make me a recommended list, fine but I don't HAVE to listen to that other stuff and this app is making it so I have to. Super inconvenient, especially while driving. I've used this app for years and never had any issues until recently.",2024-12-10 22:13:15
A ito,1,"I hate to say this, but Spotify is honestly a really bad music app. Ive been using it for years, and Ive loved it throughout, but these updates just keep getting worse and worse. To enjoy your experience, you more or less have to pay for Premium. They've gotten extremely money-hungry, not to mention the app doesn't even work half the time. My music often randomly stops playing for no reason. Also, not being able to see lyrics without Premium really bothers me. Dont recommend.",2024-12-28 02:07:05
Kayleigh Rhodes,2,"I use a 12 hour podcast for brown noise overnight. I've done this for years. For the past 2 months, Spotify skips 1-2 hours into the episode, waking me up. I've tried all of the troubleshooting tips on the help forums, NOTHING is helping. I'm so frustrated, this is such a dumb issue. I noticed that it doesn't matter the length of the podcast, it's just started skipping a lot of them.

Taylor Dixson,2,"App has become horribly unstable. The app crashes on me every other song, sometimes I get two songs in-between. I have reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, undownloaded and redownloaded all saved playlist. But the app still crashes constantly.

Tara,2,"The app itself is okay, but after a few updates, all the stuff I was able to have is hidden behind a pay wall😓 And sometimes, if you make a playlist and play it, it'll have some random song that isn't even listed or added by the app itself.

Michael G (Space Cadet),2,"I've had to change my review to Spotify because they've made it intolerably bad to use. They keep removing and changing features so that hands-free is just not an option anymore. I mostly use Spotify in the car and on Sonos. There are no hands-free options at all, Google Assistant seems to intentionally pick any song except what you want. You can't switch playlists without fumbling through your screen. I will say the Sonos has significantly improved and is now usable. Still useless in the car.",2024-10-19 07:50:53
Mandy Karja,2,"The app is a great app, very convenient to have the music still be able to play even if I wanna use another app. Although it irritates me when it plays songs that are not apart of my playlist.

Granted they can be skipped, but I don't EVEN WANT THEM THATS THE POINT OF PAYING NOT TO HAVE THEM, having the ability to skip is pointless when I have to pick up my phone a million times during a podcast to skip the stupid BOSE headphones commercials.

Avoid listening to any podcast on Spotify.",2024-11-27 03:41:13

I've watched the prices for the subscriptions keep going UP, SO many ads, & it's just gotten so bad over the MANY years I've used it. It's sad cause if there was some other app I would have left Spotify a long time ago, but until that happens I'm stuck with using it until that time comes. U can't even listen to one song without getting a ad",2024-12-28 01:45:04
Joshua Anderson,5,"As a podcast player, this app is a bit annoying when trying to listen to a queue of episodes. For such a popular player, I can't believe that they have no way to sort them by oldest to newest on Android, only newest to oldest. Update: for some reason the app is shuffling my ""my episodes"" list even though it isn't an option a user can turn on and off. Dec 2024 update: they've resolved the queue issue and the podcast listening experience is much improved. Now 5 stars.",2024-12-16 21:08:33
Mark Baldassari,3,"I've been using Spotify since day 1. And I've edited my review for it countless times as things have changed for better and worse over the years. My current review is as follows: This is still my favorite all around music streaming app. Best user interface by a landslide. That and the music library gets it 5 stars all day. But what is KILLING ME is the long awaited release of their ""lossless"" version. The lack of sound quality is what pushed me to favoring YouTube Music in my car. WIN ME BACK!!!",2025-01-06 21:39:15
Aiden “River Carver” Smith,1,"I used to use spotify alot and I thought it was the best music app, but that was only because I was paying for premium, without premium you can't even skip or pick any of the music, you can only use shuffle or play it the playlist regularly but with my playlist I have a bunch of the same people over and over and that gets annoying, plus the app usually closes when I try to use it in the background then it gives me three 30 second ads after it just told me I get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music.",2024-11-30 03:14:39
Courtney Clendenning,2,"I enjoy the variety of music provided, but I wish DJ would actually allow me to explore new genres and artists rather than just play my liked list.

Francisco,5,"Best song streaming app in my opinion. I like the way it's all layed out. You can pretty much find any song there. Only downside this app has is that if you are using the free version you are limited to 6 skips per hour you can't choose the shuffle style, and the most annoying is the Ads. I payed for the premium version which is much better.",2025-01-06 02:21:26

Also, thanks for expanding more into video podcasts and including audio books. I look forward to the day when Spotify beats youtube. Keep up the great work! One gripe: stop the location tracking with the duo plan.

I can see some songs, but only ones I've already liked, which kinda defeats the purpose IMO, since usually I'm there trying 2 find songs I wanted 2 save but couldnt.

Mary Jayne Tuft,2,This app has many great features like it's a great app if you want to discover new music but it just has too many issues. Making playlists is a pain because selecting songs is so glitchy I usually opt to just select each song manually which is so annoying and takes hours. I also can't select any song I want to listen to on my liked songs playlist even though I have premium. For an app that makes you pay so much just so that using this app isn't hell it needs to fix these issues.,2024-09-12 01:29:53
Sjizu,1,"I do not recommend this app. For instance, it is very limited for the free plan. Almost everything I can do on any other music app is premium on this one. And I have reinstalled, cleared cache, everything and the music still stops playing after a few seconds when I leave the app but keep the tab open. This app is horrible and sorta like a pay-to-win. Please do not support this app or download it.",2024-09-29 18:44:53

jared “Unforgettable” williams,1,"Please fix this app, I hate that it keeps auto playing as soon as I get in my car. It stays in my notification panel and stops any video playback if I'm watching something. It never stays off and I hate that. I have to force close it every minute of the day! I've tried so many different ways to keep the app closed but the only thing that works is uninstalling.. I will be unsubscribing to Spotify and uninstalling until this gets fixed.",2024-08-31 00:54:50
David H,3,As many songs that I have saved in my likes it always seems to play the same ones each day. When I try to narrow the list down to a certain genre it will not play at all. Then when I got to a certain artist radio it plays the same songs as the other favorite artist list. Doesn't seem to want to explore other artist in that genre.,2024-08-29 20:00:09
Jasmeet Singh,2,The app is starting to go downhill ever since the ceo fired 15% of the staff. Loading offline music takes way too long even though the songs are downloaded to my device. What's the point of downloading them if they won't load instantly? Subscription prices keep going up but we still don't have lossless audio. Going from offline music to online music takes so long I have to close the app and reopen it.,2024-08-29 01:55:23
Haylee,1,"Switching over to SoundCloud was the greatest choice of my life; This app is getting money hungry and it SHOWS. Like c'mon, limiting lyric viewing? If you're desperate, lower the damn premium price, instead of giving people more reasons to leave the app altogether. The only time this app has ever been good is when you're on a premium account, which some people can't afford. I don't recommend this app; Want music? Go to SoundCloud. It's cheaper and has little to no disappointments!",2024-11-28 00:42:17
Dave Whitaker,3,"The app is ok, but you can't sort your podcast playlist by oldest to newest. Only the other way around. So you start with what had come out must recently and then have to listen backwards in time. Unbelievably dumb. Can't believe they don't have an option to sort oldest first. Also you can look up a complete list of songs for an artist. Just the most popular and that's it. Terrible.",2024-08-25 23:48:41
Larry Crump,2,"It's fine. It's the only app that I pay for the premium, and it's constantly glitching. Specifically, it always thinks it's offline. As I'm writing this I searched a band and it showed no results so I had to end the app, and start it again. Then it blacks out for few minutes and eventually loads, and I can't add songs to playlists. Then I ended the app and it's still playing the music.

C. D.,1,"Most recent update has error with the data vs cache. Seems like data is being used as temp, causing crashing as it never dumps, and builds to GBs in size very quickly. This causes massive lag and crashing. 3 fixes -- delete data and relogin or delete app, reinstall and relogin. Or find a new app while u wait til they fix the app...

How many times are you going to replay the same songs over and over again?

Devin Wanberg,4,"Down from 5 stars. Recent changes to the app have begun to highlight othee flaws. The removal of car mode in favor of their own device really sucks. Another issue with the app is the missing song playtime in the album. Why? There is so much blank space, and even if there wasn't on significantly smaller phones, they already implement side scrolling text for song and album titles.

Whatsit Toyou,1,Same songs plays every day. I have 2 2000 song playlists and somehow on shuffle the same 50 songs from those playlists want to play. Probably because the algorithm thinks they're your favorite.. because they play all the time. Just a bad setup. Smart shuffle is cringe and embarrassing and I wish I could disable it completely. Lots of big artists like mgk have songs go missing from library all the time you can find on yt music. The only reason I'm still here is my playlists,2024-09-02 19:04:57

Thanks to this Spotify I can have music playing in the background, when I do work, and to sing along to 🎤👄 (lyrics are available)",2025-03-17 05:34:54
Sebastian Serrano,3,"the weekly recommendations each time are worse. certain things are well personalized, like 35% in general. is a company that needs to respect themselves more because they receive little benefits from their app. instead of ads each 30 minutes. put a short ad each time someone wants to skip a song. so it feels more free. put fewer options on the menu so it can look more organized and easy to choose.",2025-03-23 03:34:17
Scotty Willett,4,"I Love being able to select a certain artist and listen to only that artist so you can hear all of their music, not just the ""big hits"". Usually plays good recommendations once it gets a feel for your music taste as well. My only problem is trying to find new music that I don't usually listen to that I might like, I don't know who or what to search for and I'd like to branch out a bit. That's probably just me though. I should probably press play on random playlists I wouldn't normally click on.",2025-03-25 03:21:28
Carlos Gomez,1,"It's been utterly frustrating as of late to use this app. I've been unable to listen to the majority of my songs added to my playlist. The app would suddenly crash whenever I select a song that I have not recently listened to. In addition, even if I am able to listen to my music, the app will automatically play other songs outside of my playlist without the shuffle features enabled. I'm very dissatisfied, especially as a premium user.",2025-03-25 16:55:59
Mandarin,1,"You can't even listen to your own playlists anymore. It turns on ""smart shuffle"" or whatever by itself over and over. Plays whatever music it wants, not what you wanted to listen to. I pay for this? Not anymore. Edit: adding that this has been an issue with this ""feature"" for a year now, since it was rolled out. It is frequently complained about online and they do not fix it. I was in the top 1% most frequent users of their app last year based on their statistics",2025-03-15 08:08:04
Michael Ciha,1,"New reason for 1-star. The app will chronically stop playing audio after a song. The player indicates it is still playing, but zero audio coming out. I have to manually select another song for it to continue playing. I've had this happen after a song and also after an ad. Listen to ad that then I get told I'll have 30 minutes uninterrupted music. ONE song later, 3 more ads. And, NO. The solution is not to pay for premium. The solution is to fix your app.",2025-03-12 18:50:03
Shmev Snyder,2,"Its so easy to find good music, you can auto generate entire playlists based off one song, an album, genre, or even an emotion. I've used Spotify so long it knows my music taste so well it's almost freaky. But the ""your library"" section... omg. Liked songs don't add to your albums or artists. You have to like the entire album to put it there. To add the artists you have to start following them. But if you only like 1 song by that artist then following them screws up the recommendations algorithm",2025-03-21 03:19:13
Ali Rasheed,5,"it is honestly the best musing app to use in my opinion. sure, adds pop up but most of them are like 30 seconds, 20 seconds for the actual add and 10 seconds for some instrumental music ending. and they don't force you to buy it. you can still make unlimited playlists, listen and add multiple songs, show casts, and more. and there are even more great qualities",2025-03-18 18:24:14
A Google user,3,"Edit: Downgrading to 3 star because the couple years, it has been incredibly slow to load and often just sits on a black screen for awhile and this has been on multiple phones. *** The only music app I use because of the selection & variety of genres. My only reason for not rating 5 stars is the poor selection of international music. It would be great to have more Japanese artists, Scandinavian artists, etc but there is hardly anything.",2025-03-24 11:43:34
Chaise Miller,2,"I pay $11.99/month for premium, and have for years. I never had ad problems before, why all of the sudden do I have spotify ads in the middle of podcasts? yeah, they're skippable, but I pay to not gets ads, not to be able to skip them. honestly, I've loved spotify the whole time, but if im actively paying for a service that's not happening anymore, I won't hesitate to cancel and move on. Edit: It doesn't help. Thanks. They are spotify ads not included in the podcast.",2025-03-22 18:25:26
Little Rookie,4,"I use the app all the time, even had Premium for a while, but noticed the ad system is terrible. Spotify always claims that when an ad break is over, you supposedly get 30 minutes without ads. However... time and time again, I'll get an ad breakfter skipping one or two 3-minute songs. I'm content with only having 6 skips per hour without a subscription, but the inconsistency of their ads is almost laughable.",2025-03-20 02:18:28
Erik Oakes,4,"I love this app, personally as someone who listens to music 90% of the day it's wonderful the only issue I have is that for some reason whenever I try to use the ""new released for me"" or like other songs/artists I'd like it closes my app and basically crashes. I can try to open that tab and it'll crash, reopen the app, go to that tab and it crashes. I haven't been able to listen to more than one song on that slide thing in months.",2025-03-22 08:34:26
Denenne Poulson,3,"If you just have a TV or a laptop and have a basic free Spotify account. You can pick any song you like, and you can learn the lyrics to songs you like (most lyrics are not right for synced right). But the 2 things I hate about Spotify is if you have a phone, you can't choose the song you like, but you only have 6 skips a day and sometimes you never get to listen to the song. I wish Spotify Premium didn't cost as much money. I hope this helps you before you hit that download button!",2025-03-20 15:10:53
Icarus the Cat God,1,"I pay to play the music when I want, and where I want. That's not currently happening. It constantly ruins up the order of songs, and most of the time i can't even get it to start playing. I have to constantly close and reopen and clear cache, and for some reason double tapping seems to help, or choosing ""shuffle"" and then the song i want, otherwise i tap and nothing happens. the app is disgusting, it barely runs. This is a several yr old issue n has followed me through several different phones",2025-03-17 23:16:17
Ur Mum,1,"A terrible app. The only thing salvaging Spotify for me is the pre-made mood playlists. Otherwise, it's practically unusable for free users. Your playlists are permanently on shuffle, and Spotify will add random songs to your playlist, and you can't disable this unless you have premium. You can't even view your own playlists! Not to mention, if you look up a song, it will play something similar, but not what you looked up. Absolute garbage.",2025-03-21 19:25:11
Zachary Daniels,1,"Getting very sick of Spotify, and at this point I don't know what my alternatives are, but I'm just about done putting up with it. I pay for Spotify for the reason that I don't (at least didn't) have to listen to ads. Then they kept increasing the price, and each time the product got worse, and each time we got more intrusive and unstoppable ads. I just had to listen to the 30sec unskippable ad 4 times before my podcast played, which then immediately went into their own ads. So sick of Spotify.",2025-03-25 18:07:50
Noel Santos,3,"The content and selection is very good, better than other music apps. I'm not a subscriber so I do get ads which comes on very loud. Also white often the music or add will just stop playing and I'll have to press the play button again. Very annoying especially when you're enjoying the music and have to get up to press play. i dont get this problem with Utube music or Amazon music app.",2025-03-18 16:03:46
Sky Rogowski,1,"I miss when humans ran this show, now it's just an AI algorithm. I like using the smart shuffle to show me new songs, but it won't stick to the genre or decade. For example, a 60s psych rock playlist that already has 20 songs on it, but 80s and 90s bands get thrown into the mix because I listened to those songs on another playlist. I use the minus sign to keep it from showing up on that list again, but I'm spending more time blocking songs than actually enjoying the list lol",2025-03-18 14:42:18
J PCKP,2,"When things go wrong on the app, like ads appearing when you're paying for Premium, it's very difficult to contact anyone to resolve the issue which is unacceptable when you pay £11 a month. This happened to me recently, and when i have more time, I will be considering finding an alternative, especially if I can find a way to import my playlists.",2025-03-20 17:16:57
Jonathan Paugh,3,"Spotify's app has so many rough edges! I just listened to an ad, then tried to rewind to remember what was said before the ad. Spotify immediately showed me a second ad! While writing this review, Spotify crashed and forgot my position in the podcast. I bet I'll see a third ad. You gotta solve these basic issues to compete with YouTube! I can watch the same podcast there. Its not fair, its just true.",2025-03-26 07:55:43
box studios,3,"I love the music, but there are just too many ads. not to even mention the ""30 minutes"" of ad free listening doesn't even work. I go two songs and I get another ad. that's not 30 minutes, is it? I would have given this a 5 star if they had less ads. then my Spotify doesn't play the music I want it to play. it plays a few songs from the playlist I choose, then changes to my recommended. I'm not wasting money on premium, because that's overpriced for what you get.",2025-03-25 17:44:03
Emma Foster,4,"I have used this music platform for years and have always had a great time using it with ease. I put 4/5 stars because the latest update potentially had a bug. the app keeps becoming unresponsive and closes out multiple times whenever I try to click on anything within the app. I know it has nothing to do with my wifi or mobile data and I have even tried restarting my phone, uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, and many other attempts to fix this on my end. Please fix this.",2025-03-23 15:24:45
Harley Santos,3,"Mixed feelings on the app. While it's a good music listening app overall, you're only allowed to skip 6 songs per hour, not just that, you're also not allowed to choose a song from your playlist, even if it's your favourite song (e.g. you choose a Michael Jackson song, but the app gives you Justin Bieber instead) unless you buy the expensive, useless premium version. Aside from that, however, the app can't bother me with ads since I can bypass them by closing the app and opening it again.",2025-03-20 16:57:32
A.L. Young,5,"Spotify is my go to music app!! As long as u pay your bill!! I download em so I can hear them anywhere!! Love, love, love it!!!

THANK U SPOTIFY!! YOU R THE BEST!!",2025-03-26 15:20:53
Patrick,3,"Works okay usually, I use it exclusively for podcasts. Although after the last update my list of podcasts played reset which is really annoying, I'll have to figure out where I left off for some of these. The app also loves to randomly start playing a song from some random playlist when I've had a podcast up and playing already when switching to car or headphones. Could really use some better volume settings too, it's often just too quiet, and it can't be boosted in app.",2025-03-17 16:38:54
Christina Andrade (pumpernickel),1,"I deactivated my account not to long and in a shorter amount of time Spotify asked me to come back on a discount so I did. better than 12$ a month but just as soon as I started to like Spotify again, it has reminded me why this is not a superior service. it does audiobooks, cool right? SIKE! you only get to listen to books for a certain amount of time before it requests a charge of 14.99. the book I was reading costs that much to own! and then charge 11.99 for music service? bye!",2025-03-23 12:54:09
Lincoln Smith,1,"DOES NOT WORK ON CHROME!!! This stupid app makes me reinstall it every freaking time I want to use it.

The music is mid, and the web player is the only way I can halfway listen to my music, even though I have premium.

Rain Caramel,4,"I use spotify WAYYY too much- I pay for spotify premium, which makes spotify much better than the free version- the only thing I can complain about is the feature where you can make your own cover art.

Xavier “Maxking321” Madry,5,"Back in the days of Pandora, iHeartRadio, SoundCloud, etc. Spotify had always remained my go-to for music and audiobooks. Maybe it was the app's display and how manageable it was to setup your preferences or being able to be used across a variety of platforms like PC, Consoles Mobile devices or TV's. I'll always appreciate having been able to use the other musical service apps, but Spotify will remain my #1 to use.",2025-03-21 10:15:30
Kittencohort,5,"Super great app. I've had it for a few years now and it's pretty good. It can play music in the background and with your phone off. It doesn't take much battery life and getting one of the premium features eliminates ads and let's you download songs for offline listening. A fun bonus is the annual Spotify wrapped, which tells you about your listening over the years.",2025-03-24 02:19:43
Liz Bee,1,"Terribly created app. can't turn shuffle off. Downloading your library does nothing - it cannot access it if you are not connected to internet. It downloads when it shouldn't and costs hundreds of dollars if you aren't on an unlimited data plan. It is purposely created to break if you try to skip commercials in a podcast, to the point that it must be uninstalled and reinstalled. It doesn't pay musicians or artists what they're due. It is quite literally the worst app, RIP Google play music.",2025-03-29 21:17:24
lydia garcia,1,I liked it while it was a free trial but to me it was barely functional afterwards.. I couldn't even just select a song and listen to it. it would only play a few seconds or just play random songs . I could no longer listen to a playlist .maybe I just don't know how to use it but it was kinda frustrating.. I understand everything is a business but I wish the Business tactic wasn't to leave someone so frustrated that they end up paying to save time and stress . 😢,2025-03-21 19:26:21
dstu39,2,You used to be able to interact with songs in your queue differently. They changed it and now you can't select multiple songs to either remove from the queue or add to the queue. You can't have a separate next few songs to play outside the current playlist playing. The queue is now integrated with whatever album or playlist is playing. Not sure why they made it worse when it was fine the way it was,2025-03-09 23:57:10
The FiVE gUm InHaler,1,"This app is a complete cash grab. Removing basic features from free listeners with every update should be a crime. There's a limit on every basic feature unless I pay a ridiculous amount of money for premium. As if Spotify isnt making enough money from the ridiculous amount of ads. I get ads, when I change songs, skip or 6, 1 minute long ads, there's more ads than music on this app. Update: It's even worse, all my alarms are just ADS! I was late twice because of this, I am never using Spotify.",2025-03-16 10:35:37

Michael Gatlin,1,Long time user. But over the last two years there's been too many bugs. It feels like the devs are playing ping pong instead of addressing technical issues. Will be switching to a different music app. More inconveniences than ever. NO I do not want to turn on car mode cuz there's a Bluetooth device connected. No I do not want to use Samsung one touch login. Edit: decided to keep paying and give it a other shot. But it's still garbage. Bugs for days. Don't download or pay.,2025-03-10 21:22:13
Beth S,2,"Same old Spotify. Can't choose light mode, difficult to find relevant music because of the clutter, auto starts in the car even though I have every setting turned off and the app force closed.

Kayleb Downing,2,"pretty good for listening to music and calming down, except for the fact that when I try to listen to a playlist, instead of an artist itself, it always adds random songs into the playlist, from completely different artists because it thinks I would like that song.

The ads are really annoying, for some reason you can't play a song that you want to listen to (Like it will hust play a different song), you can't play an album in order, you can't skip songs more that a certain amount of times per say, you can't skip to certain parts of a song, you can't view song streams, and all those features are behind a paywall.",2025-03-29 06:25:48

(Update) Clicking a genre in my ""Liked"" is what's breaking my app. And while I'm here fix your stupid syncing. There's no reason the ""Liked"" on my PC app should be 230 songs behind. It hasn't updated in months.",2025-03-08 23:54:05
Em,2,"Why? why do you guys, every time the app starts to work right, do something to mess it up? Shuffle? Have you ever heard of it? I haven't since the last update. Not only does it get stuck playing the same songs, when I select a song it causes the whole app to stop. To play the song I want, I have to let it play what it wants, Queue the song I want, then skip the song currently playing. If I accidentally just SELECT the song I want it makes the whole app stop. SO ANNOYING. What am I paying for?",2025-03-27 01:29:16
xavier cabrera,1,"I pay for premium and I downloaded songs to listen off line but they won't play, not sure why but I'd like this fixed.

Ponce Barton,3,"I love everything about Spotify with the exception of still not having a premium HiFi option in 2025. All of the other major music apps have this option, such as Apple music, Amazon, Tidal, etc all have the HiFi sound/Hi Res sound option. 20 dollars a month is a lot to not even have premium sound. It makes all high quality headphones and earbus useless!",2025-03-22 04:10:59
Hannah McClain,4,Great app! Only 4 stars because usually Spotify will not let me play any like music or anything. It will all just be grey and nothing will play. But so far really good! There is many different types of music and playlists you can go through! And there is also many artists that Amazon music doesn't even have! This app is really amazing! I will definitely keep using this app! Please fix the bugs!,2025-03-14 18:13:54
Jess Z,2,"They dropped my Student discount and the app is designed so poorly you can't find your account info. The UI on this app needs some major work. Its cluttered and really unappealing to navigate through rabbithole menus. I suggest three options when user loads in. Playlists, Podcasts and What's new. Right now I have no idea its difficult to nav which is completely silly for Spotify. They also do not treat artists well so I DO NOT recommend. I hope competing app comes in soon to dethrone Spotify.",2025-03-20 21:28:32
Brylee Whitfield,4,"I've been a Spotify listener for years, and will admit that this app has little to no flaws except when you get the occasional ad and then a recording plays afterwards declaring that ""you will get 30 min of ad free listening"" and after the next couple songs (5-10 minutes later) I hear another ad or 2. it can get quite aggervating because it's false advertisement.",2025-03-20 22:36:55
Behnia,5,"Spotify changed the way I listen to music. It’s got everything I want from all over the world, and the recommendations are crazy accurate. Feels like it actually gets my taste.

Jordan Downs,1,If people are gonna pay for a premium service at least make sure the app works!!! I've used Spotify with no issues up until recently after being subscribed for almost 2 years now and the app has NEVER been this slow. I always jam from my liked playlist and now nothing will even load or it just takes forever and buffers when almost all of my stuff is downloaded on top of that! These updates are trash and really backtracking the apps progress. Can't even get a good sesh without getting irritated!,2025-03-15 10:55:57
Erin,1,"Useless app now! No longer bundles with Hulu as of this second I am canceled from it, wth, and I'm still charged the same price?

Alex Assila,1,"THE REAL REASON SHUFFLE SUCKS The reason they only 🔀 >1% of the songs you have liked is because they use your devices connectivity to a server to verify your playlist/customer info. What this means is, you don't truly have access to 🔀 your liked songs (even with songs downloaded), because the ability to truly shuffle would require all data to be available without checking for your $$$, so lazily they pick a few of your liked songs bc it saves them processing⚡️($$$) this will never be fixed.",2025-03-19 01:39:27

But now even if I drag it down, if I skip past it, I can't go back :(( and once it's listened to I can't go back to it either. Please restore this! I beg.",2025-03-09 08:04:08
Richard Bibb,1,The app is terrible. Random is a joke is picks a few songs out of your liked list and plays them over and over. It works well if you only have 20 songs in your Playlist. anyone that has hundreds might as well just pick a few and play them repeatedly. They claim you get audio books but when I tried to listen I ha to go purchase the book if I wanted to listen to it. Dont think they should say that's included with premium. over priced and to few features it's a rip off.,2025-03-24 02:25:57
Joshua Reynolds,2,"Currently experiencing 2 minor annoyances. One: Something is weird with the shuffle, especially when moving between device. im constantly hearing repeat songs when i shouldn't be.

Jose Hernandez,1,"Spotify at it again; any music tracks that you remove from your Playlists will subtly make it to your queue. We know how the industry works. All music loses appeal sooner or later, and not all music is popular. The more clicks, the better for the artist and the platform. However, the subscriber gets left out of listening to the composed Playlist that we set up for our preference. I mean, it's the only reason we pay, right? Spotify needs to back tf off. Pandora sounding good right about now.",2025-03-08 16:09:47
Rigsbee Pigeon,1,"New update sucks. Visually just ugly, premium gets more and more expensive all the time, and extremely simple features like putting shuffle on playlists are blocked behind the premium paywall. Had a minor freak out when the app said I needed to update it, and it looked like all of my songs in my playlists were removed. Maybe people wouldn't be so hellbent on downloading apks of this app if it was actually decent to use and not wildly expensive in the first place.",2025-03-08 17:39:53

I pay premium. I just don't get it. It's pathetic and the reason everyone's dropping them.

Ashly,5,"Pros: Great for listening to music and it's free!! Cons: will tell you to enjoy the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted music, play one song and then proceed with more commercials. Also something may be wrong with the shuffle because it plays the same 20 songs out of about 500+ edit: they fixed the shuffle",2025-03-24 11:20:30
Khaliid Smoot,1,"Taking my 5 star back down to 1. The app advertises the service of being able to listen to all your favorite music with Spotify premium, but Spotify only plays the 200 most recent songs I've listened to and will continuously cycle the same songs.

I can't even loop songs or skip songs without there being a limit. without premium, spotify is unusable. I can't even search for a song because when I try to listen to the song that I searched up it plays a completely different song. it makes a song into a playlist. why??? why not just let me listen to the song I'm looking for??? you need premium for everything. there's so much more problems I want to say.",2025-03-28 19:49:10

I have a new galaxy s23. no reason I can't play a song if it further then 3 down on the play list. my downloads won't work. I deleted restarted. it acted fine for like a 2 hours and then broke again and just does not load. I have to search individual songs and play them that way. if it's in a Playlist it will not play it.,2025-03-25 00:18:10

Alexi Hernandez,1,I mean I like the app design and I think it it cool like seeing other people's Playlist and all but if you don't pay you literally can do anything you look up a song you like to play and you only have 6 skips and you have to sit and wait to hear a whole album and Playlist someone else made before you can hear your song. Honestly for that I would go to YouTube or the app called muzi.,2025-03-22 14:29:27
Isabelle Bratten,1,"I hate this app. ""Thirty minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is two - five songs and then four ads in a row.

And no, this isn't ads included in the creators podcast, they are played separately before and after the podcast. No point paying for premium if you mostly listen to podcasts, purely because Spotify feel like they haven't made enough money out of you.

Thomas hitchcock,4,Great layout and can share with your friends. (I also like how you don't need an account to listen to a song someone sent you through a mess ending app.) Purchasing basic (individual) premium costs $12.99 (reduced price if you are a college student with an ID) and allows you to have no ads and an AI DJ. You can have a 1 month free trial for both Individual and Student premium Without Premium you get 2 ad's about every 3-4 songs. overall it is better then most other music platforms I have tried,2025-03-21 05:15:55

Elora,2,"I've been searching up songs and when I press play, it plays a ""suggested song"" I've never even heard of. 10 random songs later and it still didn't play the song I actually wanted. However, it is still good for finding new songs suggested to me sometimes. Even so, it's obvious that for free users on the phone, it's a pretty inconvenient music app overall. YouTube is better to do all these things without any of the inconveniences, for free.",2025-03-11 20:21:20
Mariangel Planas,1,"Ok, so I'm updating my old review. Aside from the fact that it gives me 4-5 ads after 3 songs (not even giving me the 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening it promised), it's also a major disappointment with playlists, because tell me why it starts playing my ""suggested audios"" as soon as I click on my playlist? The same one I supposedly looped, too. Not only that, but it's also songs that don't fit my taste at all and I haven't listened to in YEARS. Literally can't do anything without premium.",2025-03-18 16:51:34
Jewel Bowers,5,"I really enjoy Spotify. I contemplated a 4 or 5 stars. I am 100% committed to the 5 and at the same time wanted to give feedback for end user re: the AI feature when I use the 'shuffle' mode. I always like to use that option and hopefully teaching it the kinds of songs I 'like' that said, each time I use it, the songs on my Playlist are not varied. It sticks to the same few songs and I keep skipping and end up turning off the AI option. So far that is the only place it 'sticks'.",2025-03-27 00:48:51
Andrew Turner,2,"It's great, only when you sub to premium. When you don't have Premium, then it's literally unusable. Ads are CONSTANT. Like, you'll get an ad after every song. You might get a couple or even a few songs of reprieve before you get three ads in a row. Sometimes it gives you the ""Here, after this ad, you can listen to music for 30 minutes straight now!"" plays a song then two more ads. Without premium, you can't play any song you want, you can't rewind a song, you just get whatever it gives you.",2025-03-17 02:45:44
Stan Garcia,1,"For no reason music stops playing periodically. Most of the songs don't have lyrics, and if they do have them they don't play in sync. If I want one song from a particular artist, it will pick the whole album, and when you silence the other songs, they manage to still play. It gets aggravating when you pay for a service that doesn't work when you expect some quality. What's most upsetting is when the music just stops playing.",2025-03-23 12:37:16
Nity,1,"The Spotify app is so stupid. I'm sorry, bro. For a while, I was able to have premium features without having premium, but then it changed back. Ever since it did, my experience has been horrible. I listen to a song, and it stops randomly. Then I'll go back to the app and it restart it from the beginning. It's so stupid.

Yeah but you only get 6 skips an hour. Oh you wanna see the lyrics to this song? That's too bad. Seriously you're better off using YouTube or SoundCloud.",2025-03-07 09:49:37

You expect me to get Spotify Premium just to listen to one specific song and skip 12 times? NO. I remember when it was still free to use and i didnt have to go through the ""buy premium for things you dont need!!"" This is why i use youtube music.

Guy,1,"Well, at first I heard many good things about this app. But when I tried it first, it's constantly playing ads, it won't ever play the song I want. When I looked it up it said that it's because I don't have premium. But then what's the point of having it advertised as a ""free"" app when it only works when you pay for it. Perhaps I'm greedy in wanting this I ask, so I go to another app similar. YouTube music. And low and behold it actually plays what I click on. So this app is just a scam.",2025-03-05 20:47:07

Olivia McLeod,3,"Dear Spotify, when I chose to filter ""unplayed"" in my podcasts, please consider ACTUALLY FILTERING THEM. There's literally no point in using the filter option for unplayed podcasts, because it still shows every single podcast that you have or have not listened to. Count the podcasts we listen to as played, because they've already been played, and remove them from the unplayed filters. This is simple guys, please do better.

Let me elaborate here, the main issue is the skip limmet, I feel like being able to watch an add or two to skip more would be beneficial, like Pandora does. My main complaint is the fact sometimes you can't even listen to your own playlist, and it just adds random songs. But, that's it. Overall, it's alright.

The ""30 minutes of free listening"" is frustrating too—two songs, then ads. The queue feature is also hidden behind a paywall, which is unacceptable. I’ll be exploring other apps until the next update, and if nothing improves, I’ll just find another music service.",2025-03-02 07:18:45
RJ,1,"Terrible music app, never download it. Can't even play the dogs you actually want to listen to ad there are ads. I made a mistake that should have been a super easy fix even offering them money to handle the situation and they still acted like they couldn't even though it would have been a super easy fix on their end. Just use YouTube music instead at least then you can listen to the music you want without having to listen to stuff you don't all without paying a dime.",2025-03-07 01:07:59
Mason Thetford,1,"Android is the only version that has forced shuffle for free users it sucks, let me choose my songs and play my Playlist in order (it also has the side effect of everytime you play a song it makes a Playlist just to shuffle and it may included songs from genres you don't even like). Use it on iOS or PC instead, or better yet, use literally any other app. I refuse to pay 11.99 for a basic feature every other version, and in fact, every other app has for free",2025-03-05 17:09:35
Laila Sanchez,2,"I don't know if this is a bug, but I give this app a 2 star because when I'm trying to listen to my Playlist, it won't let me and instead it would play another song. another thing is that when I click a song like For example ""machine Girl"", it sends me to a song called ""Let me In"",""so I would say if this could be fixed please.",2025-03-05 04:17:04
Jessica Coates,1,"Getting rid of this app today because it created its own playlist called ""Wake Up Happy"" that starts playing random music whenever it wants. It plays in the middle of the night, middle of the day and it's mostly music that I have never listen to. There is no way to delete the playlist since I never created it. Really annoying.",2025-03-12 10:24:50
Ben Houchen,1,"Really loved the new ability to listen to books here. But of course it was a bait and switch. It starts off included in my membership, then it switches to only having a few hours included and I have to buy more to keep listening, at 13 dollars for 10 hours! That's at least double the price of Audible depending on how long the book is. First time in years that I've started looking for other services. I hate this time line.",2025-03-05 00:14:26
Joshua Keys,1,"Well, great job on turning a fun and easy to use music app into a complex app that's unbearable to use. What's the incentive to use this app over Pandora? or even iHeart radio? I think overall having 6 skips and having the ability to listen to specific music locked behind essentially a pay wall is downright disgusting. The direction the app is going, I wouldn't be surprised if it shuts down in the near future.",2025-03-06 03:51:10
Jay son,2,I use this app every day and I usually don't have issues but the weekly discovery playlist is so far off from music would like. It keeps deleting songs from my liked list. And it apparently has a hard on for artists that I skip more than not and is trying to play a bunch of stuff I already said not to play. I wish the algorithm was better and actually brought me to new music I'd like and not just play the same song over and over. This app is hella mid idk why I pay for this other than no ads.,2025-03-04 21:03:33
Richard Montoya,1,"We live in a world where we can't even listen to music for free. 12 dollars a month, that's almost the same as Netflix. YOU CANT EVEN LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE ORDER YOU WANT. They are taking away the ability to listen to the music we want. You have to manually search the song and then play it. Whats the point of Playlist at this point. It made sense when they had ads so they could support artists. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY LIMIT THE MOST BASIC OF FUNCTIONS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS. It's insanity",2025-03-07 07:50:30

When I select a song to listen to, I should be able to listen to it. Who's bright idea was it to play 2-3 different songs and an AD before I finally get to hear the song I wanted to listen to? Fire them. God forbid if I want to rewind a song! Or listen to it on repeat. Or skip a song I don't like. Everything about Spotify is a tar pit. 0/10",2025-03-06 00:39:00
Hunter Bennett-Daggett,1,"I've been using Spotify for years, and now use it to listen to both music and podcasts. It feels like the app gets a little worse every month.

It used to be so easy to queue multiple songs from different playlist but that option is no longer available. This selecting one song at a time and dragging it into position is very tedious.

With the new update, turning off the before mentioned AI recommended feature skips the song your currently listening to, which is incredibly annoying as it only ever gets turned on by accident.

Alex Thorne,1,"Update: instead of resolving the issues with the app, the developers have added a popup about the new audiobooks feature which keeps reappearing. Near unusuable offline or on flakey connection. The app lets you download songs but then gets stuck sometimes for 30 seconds or longer loading the downloaded playlist. Other complaints include a clunky app design that has barely changed in years, and a home screen so dynamic that I don't get a chance to try most recommendations before they disappear.",2025-03-03 13:20:52
Shane Roberts,2,Premium Subscription I only use for Podcasts. Since last update a few days ago podcasts in my playlists are not tracking the played time correctly.

I have restarted my phone multiple times and it has not resolved the issue. I do not and will not uninstall and reinstall apps. I won't do that to fix errors,2025-03-05 21:48:54
Hazel Kabluey,1,It's so messed up that the written lyrics are pay walled. That would be like a TV app charging extra for closed captions. ACCESSIBILITY SHOULDNT COST EXTRA. The audio book feature is also maddening. 10 hours total per month with Premium?! That doesn't even cover the length of most novels. But they just raised prices?! So frustrating.,2025-03-08 03:04:09
Nature boy,3,"Just better than nothing. The ads are rampant. I cannot stress enough just how many ads there are. I refuse to pay for premium, so I can only see the lyrics to three songs per month.

Loki,5,"For the most part, this is one of the best apps I've used for music, I will say, once you give into premium you probably won't go back, I wish ads gave you like an hour of free listening instead of 30 minutes, as they give you maybe 3-6 ads in a row. Otherwise, this is a great app until I purchase all my music, and It makes it much easier to find songs as it goes by not only taste but also by the year of music you're listening to, which has helped me find many good songs several times over.",2025-01-15 12:26:37

Gracelyn,1,"The only thing this app is good for is playing songs. Viewing the lyrics are limited unless you pay for a supstiption, and if you don't play Spotify on your TV, you can't click the song you want to listen too because it automatically plays a completely different song. For example, say you want to listen to (song one) by your favorite artist. You click on the song and press play, and it automatically plays (song two). It extremely frustrating, I've seen better from a YouTube playlist. 😒",2025-02-10 07:27:53
Josh Wittie,2,"Spotify is a wonderful app for finding the music you know. Beyond that, it's interface, recommendations and features are useless.

Jacob Rogers,4,"Could you guys fix the issue with DJ that happens when you switch what devices you're listening from. It causes your track name and / or time to be wrong and usually includes the unreliability of controls. Like you straight up can't control your music, and it can usually only be fixed by with a force stop of the application. Sometimes, you can skip the song, and it'll fix itself, but not usually, and that sucks having to deal with, especially when you want to save a song. PC, Samsung GS22 thx:)",2025-02-22 02:47:00

This app freezes and crashes so often, I'm starting to think the bugs are what I'm paying for. It's shocking that after so many updates, none of the issues are fixed, only new features are added which give the app more information to process so it can crash even more.

So I got premium to get rid of ads when I got my first job, lost said job and went back to free. It was so much different. Then I was able to get premium again for a bit, on and off.

The only way I found to listen to songs on my liked playlist ad free was closing the app and reopening it. This somehow got rid of the ad and went to the next song.

The shuffle setting may shuffle 10 of the same songs, which is miserable for artists that have huge discographies.

The ads that pop up, when you repeat the song all the way to the beginning, are also very annoying. And lastly, how you only have six skips per hour, also very annoying.

Raymond Drury,2,"Free version, after certain amount of ads it will freeze at the end of ad and you can't listen to music even if you close and reopen app. Literally have to wait 10 minutes or so without using the app for it to reset. Than only get 30 minutes of music/ads ahain. Tons of ads now a days as well. Good thing's is app is pretty universal and you can build your own library of music if the song is on the app. With that being said most music app you can do that so doesn't make this one special.",2025-02-22 19:22:45
Axel Estum,2,"It's okay. It has become really money hungry, though, and it shows. I can't even listen to a song without premium. Any time I use Spotify on my phone & look for a song, it's always a gosh darn playlist!!! I'm sorry but then just put your app behind a paywall if I can't simply listen to a song. This is really irritating. Not to mention, you can't rewind or go back to the last song without premium.",2025-01-15 15:23:05
anee,2,"the app used to be great. but now it is completely useless at times. the amount of adds is completely unnecessary. Four ads every two songs is absolutely ridiculous. The thirty minute breaks aren't even there anymore, I will get the thirty minute break ad and after two songs it's giving me more ads. the shuffle option is also horrible, the algorithm always gives me the same five songs. all in all, its not great unless you pay for premium.",2025-01-29 12:28:17
Alexa Crnic,1,"This app kinda sucks now. Tries to insert randomly selected songs in the middle of your playlists when you've turned off AI a dozen times that week (and it somehow turns itself back on as an option). Can't perform a normal ""shuffle"" option for its life. Doesn't show you new music anymore when you actually ask it to, instead choosing to show different songs from bands you've already ""liked."" Just gone waaay downhill in the last year especially.",2025-01-18 19:50:33
xalex monkeyx,1,"I downloaded this app for the sole purpose of playing music for a RINGTONE. As simple as it seems, the developers thought otherwise. When you clicked on a song you searched for, you either get a 1 minute add bomb, or a whole other song thats not even related in any way, shape, or form. I recommend just downloading a song off a sketchy website because anyone who made this scrap yard of a ,""app"", did not want convenience.",2025-02-09 08:12:12
Andrew Reilly,2,"Seems to have issues restarting. Takes far too much memory up for no offline listening to be available. Daily playlists that are supposed to be On demand get locked on shuffle until I clear all cache data, sometimes all app data is necessary. And the ads!!! I get it, they need to be there to keep it free. But sometimes the same ad plays twice in a row. Sometimes the entire commercial break loops even! And it's the same 3 ads for days! Good selection and variety of music though.",2025-02-24 04:51:37
Evelynne West,5,"I have used this app for a long time and would recommend to others. They even give free Spotify plus every so often with a survey. The only thing that I find a little buggy is the 30 minute ads. Sometimes it will say 30 minutes and be 15 but.. it can be solved if you just change the Playlist. Other than that, I love pretty much everything about it.",2025-02-11 07:45:38
Iakof Sharipoff,1,"This app is absolutely awful. It has so many bugs and is constantly shoving ads in your face. I recently had a bug where I could only play one song at a time and it wouldn't continue on to the next in the playlist and would basically just freeze. And the only way I could listen to another song would be to go on an entirely different playlist (which would of course only be able to play one song). Please don't get this garbage, literally YouTube is better than this trash at playing music.",2025-01-11 20:26:22
Ethan Legler,1,"Spotify took away the ability to easily select and remove songs from the queue, a feature that I used very consistently to curate a list of songs I may be in the mood to listen to at that moment and get rid of ones I'm not. Especially when using larger playlists like my Liked Songs for example. The option they do have of swiping right on the songs is nearly impossible to do. And I want to be able to do this for all songs in the queue, not just added songs. Dumb decision to remove that imo.",2025-02-22 09:17:12
James Hayes,3,"Spotify was and is still my preferred music app however there have been issues with the app recently. Whenever I go to the ""new episodes"" list for podcasts, the app crashes. Often when I am using my Bluetooth headphones I can't hear music on the app, it either takes a few minutes until the volume starts to work or the sound will cut out. My headphones will work perfectly fine for other apps when this happens, it is only on Spotify when I have these issues.",2025-02-07 13:26:20
A Anderson,4,"If I had to delete spotify I would cry. I love how I can have pretty much every song I listen to be on here and I can find more. There is one reason why I can't give it a 5 star rating though. The ads. Every three songs I get an ad and it's not so bad till you either get 6 ads in a row making longer than two songs you could have played in that time OR the same ad over and over and over again. It gets really annoying and I have tried to hit the dislike button, but it still doesn't work. Pls fix",2025-02-21 06:33:25
Savannah Smith,3,"I love music. I pay for premium, but I'm annoyed with the app, though. I have 3500 songs on my liked Playlist, and the app only shuffles the same 30 songs over and over.

Duncan,1,"Can't even watch videos anymore while connected to Bluetooth. Canceled my subscription. It's worth noting that Spotify did this on purpose because they (for some reason) think they need to police people's driving habits. It used to work fine.

Matthew Worst,1,"Even after paying for premium I still have ads before during and after podcasts. I've downloaded music albums and the playlist is not the way it was on the album when originally released. I would like to be in control in regards to when the app starts to play in my car.

Camila Cortes,1,"Too much ads at the moment, everything has become premium. The app won't even let you BREATH without it telling you to buy premium. Can't even go back to a song, can't even CHOOSE a song from your OWN playlist. I'd say, the app has become too greedy for money. I wouldn't mind not being able to listen to it in order, listen to music on a plane, but it's completely unfair to mobile users since they are more restricted to certain areas of the app and more ads, unlike curtain devices. :(",2025-01-24 01:23:36
DJ M,2,"Been using spotify for a couple years now with premium, no complaints there. Most recent update has devastated the experience. Constantly cannot skip a song or open the que without the app crashing.

It was impossible to find the bug support page or whatever so I just came here.",2025-02-27 05:48:21
Jiminy Cricket,5,"10x better than Amazon Music Unlimited for similar price. I should have switched to this a long time ago! Runs smoothly on my TV, Echo, PC, and phone (regardless of where I am). Easy to navigate and being able to pin playlists to the top makes it so fast to launch what I want. And there is ZERO harassment with ads to upgrade like Amazon constantly forced on me despite paying for the service. If you're debating one or the other, Spotify Premium easily trounces Amazon Music Unlimited!",2025-01-17 02:14:09

Julian Rodriguez,1,"Terrible app, you need to pay premium just to skip more than 6 songs a day and I can't even play the specific song I want to listen to in my own liked playlist. I'd have to skip through a bunch of other random songs before I listen to the song I chose. Then again, the limited skips keeps you from doing just that as well.

Mariana,2,Spotify is not good because when I try to skip through songs it says I can only skip six songs and I have to get premium and when I want to listen to a specific song I press play and it gives me a different song or just the preview.

Mark Mielke Jr,1,"Dude, I been with Spotify long time. And every update it gets worse n worse. I thought it was smart phone, smart apps, AI and all that!! But you (Spotify) consistently just make it more difficult, and way more importantly, time consuming to make playlists, to edit the playlist that is playing, and the algorithm for recommend songs is so far off course, there is no doubt that you (Spotify) is pushing an agenda on us, come on, let us enjoy what we spend our moneys on.",2025-02-23 23:40:57

I am 13 years old, and I have to skip those songs just in case they curse! I also cannot just play a random song, I have to add it to another playlist to hear more than just that stupid preview.

Update a week later: I no longer get the free 30 minute ads, but every other ad break just repeats the same ad 2-3 times in a row. Also frustrating, and I do want those 30 minutes of ad free back if they work.",2025-01-21 18:28:58

Goat God,2,"If you're paying for premium, it's great for listening to music!

Jacalyn Green,1,I've had this app for years and have premium for a majority of that time. I have always been able to search for an artist in my liked songs and Spotify would always play every song I liked with that band. Except now when the song ends the system either reshuffles or plays through the list of liked songs. It's extremely frustrating/annoying as I keep updating the app hoping it will work. I don't want to look up an artist or make a playlist; just let me play all the songs I like for that artist,2025-02-13 20:15:46
Brad Schmickley,3,"Mostly good. It'd be neat if the Smart Shuffle option would actually shuffle the playlist when I select a song. Currently, if I manually choose a song, it keeps the same shuffle order it had before, just plays that song immediately. Switching playlist and coming back doesn't change this behavior. So really, it just functions as a playlist with a couple of suggested songs every now and again.",2025-01-12 22:18:01
Hunter Wilde (HIGHDRONER),4,This is still a great app but I don't like the fact that they changed the way queueing works with its recent updates.

Bring that feature back please! It's a minor inconvenience but an annoying one.,2025-02-28 19:10:32
John Barnum,3,"This app has come a long way especially as far as playlist making mechanics are concerned. Unfortunately the plus icon lights up for every song that has been added to both a user made playlist and when it has been added to your liked songs playlist.

Jacob Krulcik,1,"Spotify is just like Pandora now. It plays the same things over and over and over again, no matter how many times you remove a song from every single playlist.

Additionally, If you listen to 5 minutes of the first episode of a podcast, your entire podcast thread is ""popular with listeners of that one podcast you clearly didn't like!""

Zach,3,Worked better before the update. Now it's really slow when you open the app. And when you're done with your podcast and go to the home screen to choose the next one it takes way longer to load so you can choose.

Matt Benjamin,1,"Tried it again years later and they still need to add a song dislike button to every playlist they make for you. Without it you are forced to listen to songs you don't like, over and over and over.... I cannot listen to new music on Spotify, because their algorithm then thinks I like it even if I don't.

Allison Blackwell,2,The mobile app isn't intuitive at all. When I open a song link it doesn't play the song and instead starts a playlist with a random song. It also doesn't allow me to look at playlists so I can't even find the song I was trying to listen to. The ads are frequent and random and unskippable.

And I'm stuck here wondering why you guys haven't done a patch for it or even attempted to address it from what I've seen. It just sucks how us free users get stuck with this bug.",2025-01-17 15:49:51
house spider,2,"Spotify does great when it comes to finding and consolidating the music you like. That's about where my enjoyment ends. Been paying for premium for over 4 years and still find it aggravating enough that the Alexa in my kitchen has a better understanding of genre fluidity and theme than this app. Leaving a 2 star review purely for the fact that even on smart shuffle, you will still have a terrible flow to your music. Curate VERY specific playlists. Otherwise, you'll be just as annoyed",2025-02-14 01:57:22
Jacob Karlin,3,"Could use some improvements. The music discovery features aren't very good. Also the little short music videos that play on repeat with the songs are pointless. Biggest complaint, navigating to an artists page from a song that's playing and then to that album is very unintuitive.

Domboss2019,2,It feels like this app is trying to vice grip me into a premium subscription. I only use it for podcasts anymore. You can only skip forward a song six times in an hour if you have the Free Plan. On YouTube Music you can skip however many times you want. Ill take a delay in the song starting and ads (mostly skippable albeit) at the start of most songs apposed to what i can only describe as someone choking you with limitations so they can torture you into a subscription service.,2025-01-17 04:43:14
Anthony Vailliant,2,"I can't give the app 5 stars due to some annoying features. Especially when you are scrolling through your Playlist, pick a song, and then the scroll bar automatically goes back to the very top of the Playlist losing your spot.

I tired using the smart recommendations and it recommended the same song 5 times in a half hour even though I hit the minus to remove each time.",2025-01-23 15:50:49
robert partridge,3,"The amount of times my DOWNLOADED SONGS won't play when I've lost signal is insane. Not sure if that's client side or not, regardless it shouldn't ever be an issue. Spotify accounts for about 1/3 of my phones local storage. Pretty disappointing. And STOP REMOVING/REPLACING the category filters in my liked songs. I should just have them all, for whenever I want to use them. It's so stupid to be a music app and not let me select the specific genre I want. WHY AM I PAYING FOR THIS?",2025-02-19 11:12:09
Jeffrey Hernandez,2,"In my personal experience great app. Love to use it. When recommending this app to co - workers or colleagues, more specifically older generations folks they tend to have a harder time navigating the user interface.

LavaTigerUnicrn,1,"The app works absolutely fine, playlists sometimes work and I'm able to find songs without too much trouble. The problem comes when trying to play a specific song as spotify will play it one time and then outright refuse to play it again, instead playing some random loosely related song; this would be fine if it was an issue but it's an intentional feature that will not let you listen to a specific song or use about half the apps features without paying an overprice premium fee.",2025-02-09 04:14:12
Travis Boyd,3,"It seems like with every update, listeners lose options, making the overall experience worse and worse. With the latest update, you can't remove songs from the queue that you don't want to hear. If you have an album that you like to play, and you love all but two songs, Spotify says, ""Too bad. We don't care about customer experience."" If you want to listen to a Playlist at work, and some songs are not customer friendly, ""too bad. Spotify doesn't care."" The hubris. I hope Spotify gets replaced.",2025-02-16 06:11:45
J A,2,When you finish a downloaded podcast it doesn't automatically go to the next downloaded one - it picks a random song or something else.

Support told me to submit a feature request, but this is literally a bug they introduced! The algorithm is also jacked up and keeps recommending yoga class music. I didn't ask for this. Overall it makes discovery weekly useless to me.",2025-02-11 21:34:04

The most recent update changed it so when I view upcoming songs in a playlist I can only rearrange them and not remove them. I can see how the rearranging would be useful, but to remove one for the other doesn't seem logical. Why not keep the previous feature and ADD to it as an improvement? When I use the scroll bar, it no longer shows which letter of the alphabet I am on. Now I have to guess.",2025-02-15 18:21:23

And \ or: categories which allow me to move podcasts up and down in each category... (2014) Only thing I would like to see improve in this app. It's too be able to manually adjust my own play list. Thanks Spotify!,2025-01-15 01:52:35
RedPine 20,1,"How did Spotify respond to the user vote for the option to stop video looping in the play screen? They make videos loop in the Spotify home screen. What did Spotify do with the wonderful 'discover weekly' feature? They renamed it and hid it, then replaced it with a 'smart playlist' toggle that I will NEVER use. If I want video, I'll click the video button. If I want new music, I'll click new music. If I want MY music, I click MY music. Why is all big tech like Spotify screwing up basics!",2025-02-14 23:00:06
mimmi,4,"UPDATED REVIEW: okay so maybe i was a little quick to judge. it is still a good spp, but with that stupid feature that i hate. you can only individually look at songs for a playlist when you have premium. nice going spotify. but hey if it makes people get it or whatever. layout is good overall i just wish i didnt have to pay to like a new song.",2025-01-17 14:18:14
Tom Smith,3,Good but... It seems to think I like rap and pop. Which I do not... At all... And it keep syncing to my car audio with trash I don't want to hear. Other than that. It's pretty good. Repetitive on the ads which are between 2-4 songs on avg. Also crashes sometimes. Still better than Pandora in my opinion.,2025-01-17 19:05:02
Eli Kirshenbaum,1,"Super buggy lately, consistently pausing for 1/4 second when i go into a deadzone, ON DOWNLOADED MUSIC. I know its switching from cell to download bc it only does this on the same part of a routine drive. Highway is fine, but mountain pass w/ spotty service mini pauses. The point of downloading is to NOT be using data for them. There is no reason downloaded songs should EVER stream. Also new issue where after BT disconnects, normal till I unlock phone next, then the song starts playing out loud.",2025-03-01 06:35:45
Marie Russo,1,"CANCELLED. Plays from the middle of a song, terrible basic functionality. Going to YouTube music! Refuses to play my music. STOP TURNING SMART SHUFFLE ON! I WANT TO DISABLE THIS FEATURE AND NEVER SEE IT AGAIN! Edit: I am not putting that much effort into helping you fix what you broke. Edit: Doesn't work with Sonos well. Refuses to play the song I click, no error. Hot garbage.",2025-02-27 16:16:14
William Hatton,4,"A clean reinstall seems to fix most, but: Several features to filter your music buggy: Shuffle play is also absurdly far from random. Second, you used to be able to search in your liked songs to see, say, only the ones you've like from a particular artist, and you could procede to listen to those songs. Now you can listen to one, and after it will ignore the order, doing it's default instead. Same for sorting by title: it used to play that order and now ignores it.",2025-03-01 09:13:12
Stephanie Medina,5,"My issue has been fixed, thank you 👍 I have a complaint. Every time I go to my downloaded music and click on a song I want to listen to, it doesn't let me, and my phone is making the click noises signifying I am clicking on it but it's not working at all and I restart my phone and nothing helps I have the paid version so this is ridiculous",2025-01-14 04:47:21
N K,2,"The interface is getting annoying after each update. For instance, swiping left or right to change the song is almost impossible without looking at the screen and needs to be swiped 'accurately' in a horizontal line otherwise even 1 degree off and you will minimize to player controls. Secondly, UI is bloated with useless information and links, making the overall experience too cluttered and laggy at times.",2025-02-06 20:48:08

Every time I do try to listen to a song by clicking on it, the play bar at the bottom just goes away... I'm really confused bc I've never had this issue before.

Caleb Jones,1,"This app is not as great as i expected, can't even fast forward or go back to parts I like, also I don't believe ads should be 30 seconds, that's too long also it tends to cut out sometimes and the song would start over, also I hate when I try to listen to Playlists it'll play random other songs I don't have on the Playlist instead of playing songs i put on the Playlist, that shouldn't even be a feature in the first place",2025-01-18 03:32:47
Damion Stoen,2,"Decent music platform overall if using premium. However, recent updates have brought bugs or something like that. My music keeps getting interrupted randomly. Also, the algorithm they use to shuffle through playlists needs tweaking or updating. I have 1500 songs in one playlist, and I constantly hear the same songs, I have a large playlist to hear lots of different songs not the same songs played over again.",2025-02-13 00:15:23
Annah,5,"I love this app. The only problem(s) I have with it is that when you search up a specific song and then click on it, you have to listen to a whole Playlist before you get to hear that song. Another problem I have with the app is sometimes they repeat songs half of the songs on my Playlist haven't been played in a while and because of this I have to make a new Playlist when it happens. If those 2 things could be fixed, then this app would be perfect. Other than that, this is a very good app.",2025-02-01 02:14:58
Justine mata,5,"I LOVE SPOTIFY I use android and I was using YouTube at first then in late 2022-early 2023, I have loved this app ever since, I definitely recommend this app I listen to this almost every day when I walk to school or when I am there. only downside is if you don't have premium you get 6 skips and ads, but I live with it, it's really not that bad. I think if you need a music on android or apple instead of apple music use Spotify.",2025-01-18 19:21:04
Lulu Lemon,3,"Premium is *ridiculously* expensive for what it is! £11.99 a month. For £1 more, you can get a monthly Netflix subscription on two devices at once. This app is WAY too expensive for a music player that you can only listen to on one device at a time. Please include more features (e.g multi device streaming at the very least) or bring the price down to make it fair for consumers. We really aren't getting our money's worth.",2025-02-28 21:01:35
Michael Jocham,2,"I don't know when it changed, but i never had a problem viewing songs from an artist that I had saved and downloaded only from them.

Kind of sucks when you have to be on an airplane and your used to it always working...",2025-02-08 18:29:23
Polarex,1,"Definitely pushing premium a lot more than the company used too. I've always used Spotify as background music when playing games, and they've got a bug on the ps5 that completely freezes in between ads with the only way around it being premium. I don't pay into premium for most things I've used, Especially if tolerable without, But for it to be forced on folks like that? Kind of downgrades you from people who pirate things. Goal is to be better than pirated software.",2025-01-17 01:50:36
Jennifer Tiller,2,"Insane, every time I try to play a song it plays random songs. Like and when I add a playlist it adds random songs to the playlist.

And well, now i wake up to ads instead of music. I also drive 60k+ a year. This app has gotten so bad with ads to try and force you to pay for premium. I am deleting it bc of the ads. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. I used to think this was better than Pandora. But i find myself closing this app every day and opening Pandora.",2025-02-25 11:24:45

Zach Haines,2,"They keep making UI changes to the app when this was figured out ~5 years ago. Just stop, go back even. Make it less data hungry for spotty cellphone service again. Revert back to where you can bank 1-2 songs when you go through some hills and have no service. Requiring always connected to cellular service is a garbage decision. Also, where's the higher bitrate music? That would be an appreciated change. Could cut the UI/UX cost and roll that into higher audio quality development. Updated.",2025-02-10 16:56:27
Mya Cotto Aldarondo,5,"I love Spotify, but today it's glitching?? Like, my phone has been struggling lately, but it's just Spotify, i have a different music app and it works just fine. In Spotify, once click on a playlist and the first song ends, it just stops there, so then i have to click on a different playlist and then once the first song stops, it just doesn't play anything else. Maybe it's just my device. But it's only Spotify 🤨 I already re-started my phone and logged out and logged back in.",2025-01-20 02:34:20
Lamech,1,In the Desktop and webbrowser version it doesn't play music anymore. It skips the songs in a playlist and then plays a random song for a few seconds and then stopps entirely. Spotify doesn't care and offer help or a fix. Thousands of people have this problem by now and it's an impudence cause we pay for the service to work properly.,2025-02-02 11:02:45
A Google user,3,"Update: I do npt appreciate the splashing ads. It's way too hard to down-vote/remove/ignore songs. The claim is that if you listen more, the recommendations will get better, but because I end up listening to songs I don't like, the algorithm just delivers more of the same. The ""I don't like this song"" icon (not sure what it's called) should get equal weight and be on all the same screens as the heart.",2025-02-09 17:42:13
Sapphyra,1,"You have to pay if you want to listen to anything you like at all now. I get the free version would play random songs between your songs in your playlist, but it's now to the point I will go to play a playlist and NOT A SINGLE SONG from my playlist ever plays, even after using all my skips and listening for a whole hour.

Alec Williams,1,"Search for a song, find the song, hit play, and it plays a completely different song based on some random algorithm of similar songs.

Mike Banks,1,"Only good thing about the app is that it plays in the background, it makes it so there's always a bunch of ads, makes it so that songs that aren't even in your playlist will be played, it makes it so that it makes you use all your skips (which is weirdly limited) on songs that you don't want, honestly it's just a trap to either make people quit, spend time on giving them more money, or making them pay for premium and using this garbage site",2025-01-26 02:05:56
Chad Oglesby,1,"I don't think your definition of shuffle is the same as everyone else's. I shuffle my music and hear the same song 5 times before others I hear once or not at all.

Mikey Spindler,3,"It's a good app for listening to music, however if you have one playlist that you've build for years, more songs then you can listen to before restarting it, then you'll just get a shuffle of like 20-30 songs and not random.

Eric Patterson,1,"What's going on with not working on public Wi-Fi for certain podcasts but not others? Unless I shut off Wi-Fi, then turn it back on. Podcasts size? Isn't it preloaded? Could be better. Where's the ""not interested"" button? Or dislike? I feel that this would help with the more personal experience instead of guessing with analytics testing. It would probably help AI be less redundant.",2025-01-27 17:25:44
Jasmyn Dixson,1,I would like this app more if I didn't have so many problems with it. It will randomly crash when it's playing in the background and when I reopen the app it restarts the song. It does this on most of my devices (samsung and apple). When I add songs to my queue the last song added will be invisible and the only way to see it is to move it to the top.

Crashes every time I click New Episodes for podcasts and I have to relaunch the app. I also don't like the video podcast recommendations, most are nothing I'd even listen to. You can give a ""thumbs down""; however, there doesn't seem to be a way to turn this off permanently. I don't know if it's just because of the mobile interface, but the home screen in general seems cluttered, partially because of recommendations. Premium's been great, would be better w/customisation.",2025-02-28 05:02:45
Randy Freemire,4,"Spotify seems to have a preference to showing me songs that are the modern equivalent of disco, however nowadays that's with your very standard drum and bass kind of drumbeat, that overly blocky kind of Rhythm that seems to be part of 90% of modern pop I hate it! To have that insistent bass drum over and over and over again is not musical to my ears.

Jesus Ortiz,3,"Love Spotify! Been using it for almost 10 years now, I use it daily, and it's my source of all things music. That being said, Shuffle and Smart Shuffle have not been suffling correctly.

Nelson Pena,2,"Music selection is fine. The app however tells you enjoy the next 30 mins ad free. After one or two songs, plays more ads, plays a song or two and does even more ads. This in the 30 min window that was supposedly ad free. So whenever I decide to try Spotify it basically lies to its users.

Sgt Scott (Z3R0xON3),3,Had good features but too invasive abuses you privacy. It abuses Bluetooth tech to map everything and even tried to connect to unknown devices. On by default.

D K,2,"In general I really like spotify. However, the recent change away from the liked songs button makes using it confusing. Sometimes when you press it, it'll add a song to your liked songs. But other times, it'll add it to the playlist you were on. This is horrible area as it make it a button that you don't know how it acts.",2025-02-07 22:25:30
Mira,3,"I have been using Spotify since 2016 and I have noticed recently how much Spotify is relying on AI to recommend music and it honestly sucks. I am the type of person that loves exploring new music and Spotify used to be great for that (go to song radio)! But now all the recommendations are stuff that is already in or similar to my library, which is not the vibe. It feels increasingly more difficult to find playlists curated by people or that aren't updating all the time. It feels empty.",2025-01-23 16:51:23

Michael Gill,1,Worst music app I have tried. I have repeatedly found pirated content while looking for audio books. Probably because unless you are interested in the 20 or 30 audiobooks they are promoting (of the two million published a year) it is almost impossible to find anything. And good luck finding podcasts. I pay for the family plan so my kids can have their own playlist. No luck - Spotify forces only one stream at a time - especially if you use a smart speaker.,2025-02-02 01:27:16
Ţąłęɲ Mąţhįş,1,I can't even choose a song to play on a playlist... it plays in random order and when I look for that specific song.... it leads me to the song... but when I tap on it... it's just a jumble of random songs... it's stupid... I can't rewind on songs... I can only skip to the next song... ITS STUPID... other than that it would've been great.... but now a can just play the song I feel like playing in that moment...,2025-02-06 22:26:08

I also don't like how free users can't pick what song they want to listen to but have to hope that it comes on within the 6 skips they have. Now it won't let me use the app.,2025-02-07 03:05:54
Matthew Nardozza,1,"Constantly crashes my phone. Looses place, ignores commands... Still no improvements in years. Refuses to update. Routinely crashes while still playing audio with no way to stop or mute. Worst podcast system I've ever seen in my life, and that includes just a single html page with an rss feed.

Melanie Huffmaster,3,"I love the app, I've been using it with premium for a few years now. But the updates have got to stop. The app was perfect already before the most recent update - the new and ""improved"" queue update. I hate it with a passion. Maybe it would be weird of me to switch over to a different music app solely for this terrible update, but if your service providers don't change it back to the way it was before, I'm not sure about it. Otherwise it's a great app.. but please change it back!!",2025-02-13 03:00:45
A V,2,"I love listening to my music, but it was entirely ruined for me tbh when I found out I had a limit of audiobook hours.

Cody Hughes gomez,3,STOP CHANGING STUFF! The main reason I used Spotify over Apple Music is because you could select and remove multiple songs from the queue at once without swiping each one. Now that's gone for no reason. It's now arguably worse from a user experience side. I'd rather you fix bugs and improve the layout of the UI not remove features.,2025-02-15 17:00:02
Moist Amity,1,"If it wasn't for being on a family plan which I don't pay for, I would never use this app again. Spotify is rigged. You can have a 1000 song Playlist but spotify will only let you listen to the songs they think you want to hear. I hear nearly the same 5 songs every time I shuffle my Playlist like it's the radio and I'm sick of it. Quit putting my Playlist that I created from thousands of hours of listening through your horrible algorithm. When I hit the shuffle button, do just that. Shuffle it.",2025-01-20 07:39:44

I like it, I use it and I recommend it.",2025-02-22 04:37:05
Mason Deterding,3,After a few months I really wanted to enjoy it. But apple music is honestly a super power compared to this. What would be better is if it let you download albums and songs instead of having to do it in a playlist. There seems to be an obsession with playlist has just become so obsurdly annoying that I went back. If they fixed that it would be more friendly to users coming from iPhone.,2025-02-12 06:19:26
Laura Lovitt,3,"I love the app but can not afford another monthly bill so i enjoy it for free WITH ads. Lately I have been hearing ads after almost every song. Sometimes 4 ads in a row.

Can you fix??",2025-02-05 19:58:23
Avram Neal,5,I have premium and it's totally worth it. The freedom to listen to whatever whenever without any interruptions is better than I thought.

This is never the case as there's approximately 4 long sets of adds within approx 20 mins or every 2 songs depending on the day. This definitely isn't 30 minutes of add free music.

Frustrating to skip through 100 songs straight to get back to random. Please fix. The ""previous song"" button should take you to the last song you actually listened to. If you ""add to queue"", play that song, then afterwards press ""previous song"", it will be like you never played the queued song. Very silly & unhelpful design in my opinion. At least put in settings.",2025-01-26 00:37:58

The older version of the queue was fine why on earth would y'all mess it up like this? Seriously I just have to ask, WHY? PLEASE get rid of this new update.

Dausha White,5,"I love it. It comes on/goes off automatically when I get in and out, once paired to my vehicle. I pick my genre and it plays songs that are similar. If I don't like a song I press the minus on the right side of the screen and it goes to the next song. Great app...a lot better than when it first came out.",2025-02-14 17:43:17
Isaac Williamson,2,"It has all the music I listen to. I also enjoy the option for listening to audiobooks. It costs way too much for premium though. Audiobook top-ups are ridiculously expensive too. I pay for Spotify, because I absolutely love listening to music. Otherwise, it is not a good deal.",2025-02-02 04:50:08
Michael P.,1,Absolute garbage! How does an app that's been around for 15 years get worse and worse every update? I don't want to follow every artist to see their new releases pop up in my notifications. Give us new releases on the front page and actually update it every day. I shouldn't be finding out my #1 artist from last year put out new music 3 weeks after the fact. 🙄,2025-01-18 02:44:06
Zakary Huebner,1,"On Samsung Galaxy a15 (android 14) can't be set to never sleeping app, all permissions have been granted as well as background data usage enabled, likewise unrestricted battery use. Amafter about 10-30 mins max the app just stops & shuts down in the background while using other apps. This is ridiculous. I pay for premium, been using Spotify for years as a premium member. Seriously considering subscribing to YouTube music next billing cycle. (Note this still occurs even while in offline mode)",2025-02-21 09:47:06
Ameerah Patterson,1,"Every time I try to play a specific song in my likes, it won't play so then I have to click 10 songs above the specific one I wanna play and either swipe or skip until I finally reach the song I wanna play. If I play a song and my screen turns off, it'll continue to play but will scroll all the way back up to the top of whatever playlist I'm playing from. This is highly irritating and has been happening since January. I hope it gets fixed soon.",2025-03-07 01:03:48
john dreher,1,"Constant ads, even after watching an ad saying you'll get thirty minutes uninterrupted. Constant emails asking you to pay for spotify Premium and constant pop-ups in app doing the same. Spotify will decide you like one song in a genre and suggest nothing other than that genre. The AI they use now is garbage. All I have to say is that in our world, companies will treat you like garbage as incentive for you to pay them to not treat you like garbage. That is not a tactic I respond too well",2025-02-14 01:25:38
Scooter McHooter,1,Pretty much useless to try and use it with Android auto. The app has been terrible for a long time but specially now. It doesn't Auto download podcast even when that option is checked. It doesn't Auto delete watched episodes even if that option is checked. It won't auto play oldest to most recent podcast always seems to bring up some random undownloaded podcast from 6 months ago that I've already listened to. Basically there's no good option for hands-free use.,2025-02-19 21:05:37
Lyric Watkins,4,the app itself is not bad but when it comes to adding songs to my likes it takes a while to add and then my likes songs aren't all loading I know I have a lot of songs so it takes a min to load but it doesn't update with the genre or how many I had added if there anyway I can update to be a little faster or just without resetting my Spotify that will be great,2025-03-14 23:50:57

Jennifer B,3,The new update for organizing the queue is glitchy because when i move a song up or down it flashes and goes back to where it was and then goes where i put it.

Chantel Hyatt,5,Love the awesome variety of music from newly released music to older harder to find music. Love how the app shows the lyrics and selects playlists based on music that I enjoy listening to. The offline option also makes listening without wifi a breeze.

I think the tempo and most dominant sound in a playing song is how the next song is determined. But it's not as efficient as YouTube music. Oh! I really love how that I can enjoy podcasts without ads and also download episodes to listen offline, no matter what plan I'm on. Spotify really did great on that one. I also love the captions for podcasts feature.",2024-11-08 06:53:17
Rose Stojanov,1,"While I loved Spotify and currently have a premium plan, I will be canceling it. It stops at every song by itself. At first I thought it was because I had my phone on power saving mode, but that's not the problem either. It's very frustrating!! I've given this feedback before, but unlike some apps, you don't even acknowledge the feedback! I don't know what happened to you, instead of improving your product, it's deteriorating!",2024-10-30 17:15:44
•Alice•,3,"Overall, Spotify IS good. But recently, it's been changing. The desperate amount of ads and features that have been blocked for non-premium users is frustrating. You're only allowed to skip 6 songs per hour, are forced to listen to your playlist on shuffle, and now, the lyrics have been also blocked... I feel like that is a bit too much and the app should be a little more accessible for non-premium users, so we can enjoy it too 😋",2024-12-13 16:33:00
Alex Harford,2,"Poor UI. Ads pop up when I pay for premium (disguised as something I might like). Ads on podcasts. Often unable to access downloaded library when offline. Very frustrating there's no option to disable sync between devices. Buggy, especially when listening to podcasts. Downloaded huge video files without my permission and had to find settings to change that. Still have to be careful the app doesn't waste my data if I'm online but not on WiFi.",2024-10-20 10:48:03
Carrington Morrell,4,"I will say that I have been using spotify for years now. I will also say that if you don't want to spend money, this music app isn't for you. If you're using the free version, you have skip limits (mine is 6 skips pure day, which is annoying), you can't hand pick songs, you can't download songs, and you can not switch your playlists off shuffle. I loved when spotify took a break from all those things I mentioned because I LOVE to skip songs, and I liked that free version much better",2024-11-21 06:23:41
Ed,1,"Crashes constantly, even with no apps running in the background. Happens for almost every song. I tried to fix with all suggestions Spotify made, cache cleared, no downloads. Nothing. It has been unstable for years. It can't be the phone, as I just got a new S23, and this is still happening. I will be cancelling my premium. Awful user experience. Sick of this. If I could give it 0 stars, then I would, because the app is borderline unusable for its primary function!",2024-12-09 12:13:06
Mike F,1,"Like most apps now, it's set up to be as user unfriendly as possible to people not wanting to pay for a premium account. Search for a song and press play and the app will proceed to play two to three completely unrelated songs to try and get you to use up your ""free"" skips. So your choices are skip multiple songs just to get to the one you wanted or listen to six minutes of random music to get to the one song you were looking for. Embarrassing",2024-12-21 23:17:39
Sarah Duke,1,"Was generally satisfied with the paid service before latest update, EXCEPT for the fact that as a company you are blatantly exploiting artists. And since the update before last to the app, skipping or resigning to previous track is extremely unpredictable if pressed more than once - will skip 5 songs instead of 2 for example. It also now plays the first few seconds of a song, then goes silent (but still shows it is playing). WiFi is working, it's definitely the app.",2024-12-18 12:39:22
Courtney C,1,"Spotify premium price went up, for the app quality to drastically go down. I can't search my downloaded songs when offline - what's even the point then?? And trying to select different playlists to browse just makes the app crash. out completely. Two feeds for the same content (podcasts/Patreon podcast) is confusing and fiddly. Audiobook time limits are also low, in my opinion. ""Random"" isn't random, and generated playlists are too repetitive",2024-12-05 20:49:04

This year's wrapped was lame, I, like everyone else wanted to see my top five genres, not three featured months. Many people I know complained that they're wrapped was incorrect and used other apps to see the true numbers.

De la Rey Myburgh,3,"Recently, it feels like the premium subscription is offering less value for its cost. One thing I recently discovered was that there is a limit on audiobook listening hours, and they will try to get you to pay extra to continue listening (this is with the premium subscription). I don't remember seeing this when I signed up, so if audiobooks are part of the reason that you want to sign up, I would recommend looking at other options.

Tom Vopni,1,I am a family member and have been for years. The podcast commercial loop hole Spotify is exploiting is out of control.

This is similar to when they increased CDs to $27-$30 per album and we all started downloading music for free because it wasn't worth it to pay for it anymore.",2024-10-03 16:47:32
schlauhonk,4,"I have always loved spotify, but I must say the most recent update just ruined the home screen. There used to be tons of suggested playlists, ""made for you"", etc. The only thing that remains are the six most recently listened to playlists.

Barely 1 book in most cases, barely 1 week of listening to/from work on my commute, then oh no, have to wait another 3 weeks to finish it. Forget listening while you work.

I installed it for just ONE song and this gave me nothing. Uninstall it is then.",2025-03-29 01:24:49
Tom Boniecki,2,"I don't use Spotify for music any more. I use it for podcasts. It used to be a decent app when I started but with each update it's getting worse. Gone are fast forward, skip, speed controls from the login screen. Now the speed control resets to 1x after every use, and the episode history is gone too. I realize that podcasting is not its primary function but I still can't understand taking away of the features. I'm done.",2025-03-23 14:36:58
Soph B,2,"The audio difference between music and advertising is ridiculous. I know you want people to pay for your app, but this seems like a really shoddy thing to keep doing. This was a meme years ago, but it seems worse now than ever. lately I've been getting 4 of the same, obnoxiously loud adverts in a row when listening to podcasts. If there was a good alternative I'd go there. But unfortunately there isn't. The vast collection of music is pretty good though.",2025-03-10 10:45:50
Shaheen Sopariwala,3,"Each playlist keeps giving me the same song on repeat, and I hate it . You need to change up the shuffle system a bit , it would be much appreciated.

Hope you take my problems into consideration!!",2025-03-09 11:22:31
Nicole Claire Gentles (Claire),2,"This app frustrates me often. It will just stop functioning normally. I can't select a particular song to play; it will only allow me to play the whole library. Force-stopping the app doesn't solve the issue, nor does clearing the cache. Connectivity between devices can be hit and miss. Sometimes it won't play ""downloades songs"" if there is no internet connection. The day I find the energy to rebuild my music library in a different app, I'm cancelling my subscription.",2025-03-24 13:25:11
Hey Andrew,4,"For me, I totally recommend using this app if you want to listen some music or even podcast that can help you focus and vibe with the song!

The past 2 weeks it won't load whenever I open it up, so I have to uninstall it, reinstall then log back in. And I've had to do this every single day, every time i reopen the app. What's even more annoying, when I have something on loop like an album, when it's finished, it just plays suggested songs which I don't want at all. I'm really annoyed and tired by this",2025-03-23 12:01:15
Vic AV,5,"TERRIBLE UPDATE!! Spotify has been my favorite and only music app for years now and it has always been practical, everything on reach in two clicks. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE. New update forces a long path to be able to search in your liked songs, no longer having that amazing helpful search bar on the top. It will ignore any search made on the queue and just play whatever it feels like instead of results for the search which was PERFECT. You made it all complicated. Premium isnt worth it now.",2025-03-26 15:35:07
Vasiild,5,"Spotify is awesome for music and podcasts! Super easy to use, has great playlists, and the recommendations are spot on. 👍🎧🎼 I do have a small suggestion regarding albums for free users.

I still like listening to the podcast on Spotify.",2025-03-23 18:28:49

Now you can't listen to whatever song you please and the lyrics don't show up (or sync) 95% of the time. You can't listen to songs in order and you can only skip a number of songs per hour.

There's a '30 mins of ad-free listening' feature after you watch a couple of consecutive ads, but it only works sometimes. The video for the song is sometimes wrong, not all songs have available lyrics and there's a limited number of skips per hour.

Rhiana Belle Elcarte,1,"Spotify is one of the best music apps in the world. However, I find its limitation on the number of skips frustrating. The inability to freely choose and play specific songs diminishes the listening experience. At times, the app randomly selects songs instead of allowing users full control.

I am not complaining about the ads since it is understandable but PLEASE Spotify.",2025-03-16 15:47:58
Kim Raphael Nitsche,5,"I've been using Spotify for years now, and I can't imagine life without it. With Premium, everything runs super smooth, no ads, top-tier sound quality, and offline listening whenever I need it. The personalized playlists, such as ""Discover Weekly"", always hit the right vibe and help me discover new bangers. Sharing playlists with friends is easy, and with the massive song selection, there's always something for every mood. Spotify Premium is 100% worth it.",2025-03-17 21:32:39

My playlists are full of songs I didn't put there, and I can't afford premium to stop it. Sorry, but I don't like this app anymore. I am only reinstalling it so I can have music in the background.

Jon Wilton,4,"Spotify is great, would give 4.5 if that was an option! They always have the albums and songs I want to listen to. My only complaint is that while they are constantly making updates, some of them aren't quite ready when they hit the app. I love the addition of video podcasts (I'm definitely Ringer-pilled) but the integration has been choppy so far.

Seany D,2,"Totally different review this time! It's starting to get really annoying that my Liked Songs playlist doesn't load now! If I enter into a different part of the app then go back to where I was in my library it then jumps back to the top! I then have to scroll to where I was cus it also likes to skip songs, sometimes a few in a row! And when I go back into the app after bein off & the music bein paused for maybe 5mins at least, it doesn't let me play any of my Liked Songs. I pay for this fyi...",2025-03-17 14:14:30
ビビYorvia,1,"Unless you pay for premium, the app will make it absolutely impossible to listen to a full song from an album you made. And that's without counting the obnoxious amount of ads. It has a great UI, yes, but to have ads on a music app is a mega dealbreaker for me, considering they already have more than enough to support the app without ads from the actual people who do pay for premium",2025-03-21 17:39:37
Malachi Schroeder,1,"Horrible app, both on mobile and desktop. VERY slow, takes multiple seconds to load when i click on anything, smart shuffle doesn't work half the time. They even messed up random seeding for shuffle, its the same every time. Also often randomly switches to other device. Cache is quickly like 10gb It's bizzarre that spotify's whole product is the app yet their software is genuinely garbage and they don't even care. On top of this they pay next to nothing to the artists.",2025-03-24 16:45:59
Little Walrus,1,"This app has SO MANY ads. After every song it will feed me 10 different ads, which keep replaying again and again. This is an entire hub for ads. None of the ads shown are relevant to me, and keep repeating. Even when it says it will give me 30mins without ads, 1 minute later it will show 6 or 7 different types of ads. This app is swarming with ads. In 20 minutes, it will show you at least 100 ads I guarentee. Do not download.",2025-03-26 20:31:30
Rittik,1,"The app is no more for normal users i guess I mean i literally have to listen too much adds in 30 min which means everytime I change songs adds show up and even after next track the add plays it's more like the team just wanna full pockets and nothing more.

Shubham Singh,2,"Spotify can be frustrating at times. I can’t even play random songs one after another, can't create playlists easily bcoz it's a paid feature, or download music.

D MacAlpine,1,"With every update it gets slower and more bloated. The UI elements get shuffled around more than a deck of cards, making the user experience frustrating.

A Google user,1,"I used to love this app but it's not user friendly like it used to be in 2017. Just like the PC version, it's horrible to navigate and use. The old UI was a lot easier to navigate.

Like my playlist is full of sad songs and then the next it just starts playing some random happy song! Or like when I'm listening to anime openings and endings, it would just play something else!!

You can't chose which song ls to listen to next, and you get limited skips, you can't even shuffle your own liked songs. For podcasts as a free listener the app works great. The really annoying part is if you pay for the monthly subscription, your music listening experience is amazing, but your podcast listening experience does not change. You still get regular ads. This app is only decent if you pay for it.",2025-03-19 01:07:49

Kamo,1,"spotify treats free users like garbage. we can't even listen to our ads because we are constantly being interrupted by the music (if you get what I mean). it seems like if you don't have premium, it's extremely difficult to listen to music because you are constantly bombarded with ads, disgusting ""smart shuffle"" that plays the most irrelevant songs that don't even correlate to your actual music taste and a skip limit of 6 songs per day??? now I am expiriencing double ads aswell. annoying as heck",2025-03-24 02:59:17

Sure you can go into recents and you may recall what day you listened on but certainly on the phone app it not very practical. Never use the DJ. Quite rubbish I think,2025-03-09 17:41:52
vale,1,"yet another app ruined by greedy developers. im honestly very disappointed, because only a few years ago this used to be the best choice for streaming music. premium used to be an optional payment for specific features, but now the app has become pretty much unusable without it. you can't even choose which song you want to listen to, like isn't playing the music you love the whole point of the app? not to mention the absurd amount of ads there are. i don't think i would recommend this to anyone",2025-03-08 17:08:11
Kitty,3,"It's good, you can listen to a lot and It's nice that you can listen to music with friends but that feature is not as good as it could be. For example when we do not listen on the same speaker, the person who joins will have a lagging song and sometimes their songs in the queue will be skipped. The app in general freezes sometimes and uh yeah. Not bad but should do better.",2025-03-14 06:22:15
Amira Arissa,2,"Too many premium, I can't even enjoy it. What happened in the updated version? Oh nothing, just the ability to fast forward and rewinding got taken away. Only skipping is available. No option to put the choosen song on repeat as a phone user. This app could be great if this problems never occur. Just hope there's no more premium in the future, cause I ain't spending my money for this. It's as if you guys are desperately trying to get us to buy premium. But I know the developers tried their best.",2025-03-08 03:52:15

Well, it Was the best app, until an update changed everything, and the choice to make a playlist the way I not only want to, but also need to (again: Autie..), are gone.

However, frequently played songs are cached locally to save data. If I want to officially download a cached song, Spotify won’t allow it without Wi-Fi, even though no extra data is needed. It should simply move the cached file to the downloads folder instead of enforcing the Wi-Fi restriction, making offline music management more efficient.",2025-03-08 05:39:06

It needs improvement from the limitations it has.",2025-03-26 10:15:57

This is the least you could do and the premium version should have PREMIUM FEATURES, not basic human needs. @spotify please fix this because my friends and I aren't paying for this and million others online say they won't. If anything you'll lose users and your company takes a bad hit.",2025-03-06 03:49:06
Naima Njenga,3,I really like the app it's something I use almost every day but there's some things I would change in the free version of the app starting with letting people skip the song without any trouble on mobile but on laptop / pc / computer I can skip as much as I would like to. One more thing I'd like to add is that when i search up a song and then press the play button it doesn't give me that specific song and i end up having to skip all the others.,2025-03-04 09:57:29

Thejaketho Sopfü,1,"used to be good but now, nope. It's understandable that the company needs to put ad's since it's free but at the same time it's way too much and some necessary features which are not ""wants"" but important features like shuffle, repeat, choosing a song etc. all require premium, the worst part is, being forced to listen to songs we haven't even added on our playlists.",2025-03-06 18:42:14

I was ok when it was just shuffle, but I DON'T want any random songs when I have my own playlist. I'd rather just switch over to YT music. Their premium is reasonable because it is for both the app and the music app. Really pathetic of you spotify.",2025-03-12 07:36:53

Whats the point of this app. I dont want to listen to random songs when i want to listen to a specific song. its practically oppression. The omly reason i still have this app downloaded is to transfer songs from my playlist to the one on my youtube music (i have over 1000 songs and i cant be bothered to put all of them in the playlist at once).

It will not allow you to skip more than six songs and also won't let you pick certain songs after a while too. So, pretty much the only way to listen to your stuff is to pay for premium, which I don't really think is worth. It's kinda just a scam...

It's become so swarmed with AI ""features"" that it's getting hard to use it normally, I don't know who told you people like AI slop but we DON'T!",2025-02-19 12:57:17
A Google user,1,"I'm extremely frustrated with the Spotify app. Despite being updated, I've experienced a persistent issue over the past two weeks. Every time I exit and reopen the app, I'm met with a blank black screen - no UI, nothing. Repeated attempts to reopen yield no results, and the app only seems to work again after a day or so. This glitch is infuriating and needs to be fixed ASAP. I tried reinstalling too, it works for a day and then back to showing blank screen.",2025-01-15 07:47:46
inky bitz,4,"I'm using the free service and wanted to see if it was worth paying to join. I'm disappointed by the fact that although I chose a certain song to play it plays a completely different track! I was pressing on the correct track, but it played another by the same artist. This has happened many times when I chose a single track or even an album. Update - Following advice from Spotify it seems to have sorted out the problem, thanks. Dunno why I didn't think of that!!",2025-01-10 15:55:56
Daniel Chilufya,5,"I've been using Spotify for over a year now, and I can't recommend it enough!

Whether you're into pop, rock, classical, or indie, you'll find something to suit your taste. 2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The app is incredibly easy to navigate.

Andreea Manea,3,"Spotify has major usability issues: You can't download individual songs, only full albums. Removing downloads from playlists is impossible without deleting the whole playlist, and even that isn't intuitive. Offline mode is broken: Downloaded content won’t load without WiFi. Finding the currently playing song in a playlist requires endless scrolling. Overall, it's frustrating and counterintuitive. Please fix :)",2025-02-19 05:51:57
Lwandile Maqondwana,4,"Love the app. It has a huge selection of music. I just have few issues: 1. When you hide a song, the song will still play even though you don't want to listen to it. 2. Having premium means you can listen to your downloads without the worry of internet connection. However, when I try to listen to my music, the selected album folder won't play without internet connection. PLEASE FIX THIS. 3. Please make mark selection option, so we can select songs we want to remove Easley and not wait three seco",2025-01-22 12:03:43

Elena,1,"Annoying. Almost everything is paid. You can't play your Playlists in a line. Only skip songs 6 times an hour, and there's a limit to the number of songs you can play that you search for. It ruins the listening experience, especially as a free user. Moreover, the number of ads is definitely frustrating and repetitive. Similarly, you can't really view the lyrics most of the time, which spotify has limited too. This is the only ""proper"" music platform due to less competition, really disappointed.",2025-02-05 18:56:24
Saket Dhulipala,1,"Spotify used to be absolutely great! My go-to place for all music, however now it's absolutely horrible, you have to pay for EVERYTHING. Want to skip music? Nope!

I can't play a single song in any playlist, spotify knows I selected the song but it won't play it, it'll just cancel the song I'm on. I've tried everything; restarting spotify, logging out and in again, restarting my wifi, restarting my phone and ect. If this goes on for another month then I'm canceling my plan.

On android, it will get back at top which is annoying specially if you want to play some songs in that part of the list. And way better if you make the search bar on the playlist to be floating so that we can search for any song while scrolling through our playlist.

Now it's so poor that it puts the most obtuse and jarring songs in playlists and makes an effort to insert songs that you constantly skip with no rhyme or reason. It used to do a fairly good job of playing new music and matching vibes and genres. It's awful now. I spend a lot of time skipping and then an hour later, skipping the skipped song. Smart shuffle is trash too.",2025-02-21 11:27:58
Emil Stoyanov,1,Could not fully and freely explore the app because the app is stopping me. I tried to create a playlist and I always ended up with the app putting songs in it instead of me. That effectively makes the playlist feature useless. Instead of me listening what I like the app is trying to tell me what to listen in hope that I may eventually hopefully like it... maybe.

Marcell Jensen (Marcey),2,"I use it constantly and have for years, however the current development team seems to have their heart set on making it unusable. It's looking like its time to jump ship. Every new feature is a worsening of functionality. Specifically the new queue format is just objectively worse than it used to be.

Can not listen to single album, it keeps switching to others or back to biased recommendations.

Spotify is something I can't live without but one thing that tickles my pickle in a bad way is the fact that I can't fast forward my songs, when they removed that feature it really bother me. It's not a big deal now, but what is a big deal is the fact I can't pick songs freely anymore, like I need to wait 6 hours????

Not good when paying for premium",2025-01-31 09:58:12
Nat Bird,4,Good interface and easy to use. My only issue is that despite having an offline mode it often gets stuck trying to use data and can take a while to recognise that you are offline. It would be nice for there to be a toggle for offline so that it's seamless to switch. I say this as I travel a lot for work and it can be frustrating having to wait for Spotify to eventually switch over to allow you to use offline content as it tries to load the whole app and all it's content first,2025-02-10 17:46:06
Amar Roy,1,"Eww! Such a disgusting app! Not only does it not play the song you choose, but also it ensures to play songs instead that are diametrically opposite to the kind of songs you're trying to listen to.

Paul Muthuya,2,"The app is good-ish. One bug that I think you've ignored enough is the issue related to when someone decides to use SD card storage. If accidentally or purposely, the phone restarts or switches off, we tend to lose every goddamn piece of information we had stored, and all the offline content simply vanishes so we have to redownload the podcasts and playlists. It's become an inconvenience especially since the reason someone downloads content it's because they want to listen to it offline😭",2025-02-09 17:25:35

Now you cannot delete tracks from the queue anymore, put them from the queue into the regular playlist or and them to the queue again. Please revert these changes and the app will be way better again.",2025-01-15 16:10:01
Ashlyn Miles,1,"It used to work fine. I'm not sure what happened but if they don't fix this soon then I'm gone. They keep upping subscription prices and can't even be bothered to fix it. I try to tap on songs to play and way too many of them just won't play, even songs I've downloaded, even local imports. It'll just stop. I've tried closing the app and opening again. I've tried uninstalling then reinstalling. There's fundamentally something wrong with the app since other people here are having the same problem",2025-02-28 07:46:46
Uma Kanojia,1,"I'm appalled, disappointed, and frustrated with this music app. The developers prioritize greed over user experience, bombarding you with prompts to upgrade to premium the moment you open the app. Want to play a song of your choice? Premium. Want to create a playlist? Premium. Want to listen to a single song without ads? Premium. This aggressive approach is insulting, implying that the developers don't care about your music preferences or experience. Hate this app!",2025-02-12 03:49:04
Meredith Priestley,4,"Awesome for listening to music! Can be a bit glitchy and slow at times but easy to use once you get the hang of it!! I love using it to assemble playlists which I can share with my besties, although it's not so good for wanting to listen to specific songs in a certain order because you have to pay to be able to do that.",2025-01-17 22:34:16
Tobias Roland,1,"There are tools to migrate your playlist away if you're worried about the effort you put into tying yourself to Spotify. Spotify is a perfect example of an app that is enshittification in action. Everything from removing song length information to making albums harder to find. It's made to get us to listen to whatever they want to push hardest, and the cracks are showing now. The Spotify wrapped was exemplary AI slop, and the ""courses"" are just exploitative scams by crypto/ai bros.",2025-02-23 10:27:35
Luiz,4,"Good app, decent audio quality, plenty of musics and artists. Sometimes the music I'm currently listening somehow is removed from my personal playlist for no reason at all. It's worse when I can't remember the name to search and add it again. Waiting for this bug be fixed, until then 4 stars.",2025-02-08 18:39:55
Bhaveeratha Virati,1,"This was the best music app ever ""WAS"". The new app updates just removed the basic features of the music app, almost everything requires premium now. I've been using it for more than 4 years, These new updates didn't make anything easier or better, everything seems to be useless at this point. Listening to music was perfect before, now it's just annoying coz there's literally no way of listening to songs the way we want to, deleting is the only solution if this doesn't change.",2025-02-05 15:52:36
Ma tt,1,"can't believe I pay for this... videos won't play when I'm a passenger In a car and the algorithm that suggests music has completely stopped working lately doesn't suggest music in my tastes anymore. worst music app I could imagine and it's the only choice. very good opportunity for a new company to open I wish I could give my business to a different app It's been years this review remains unchanged. None of these issues have been fixed. Spotify; ""oh our app has issues? piss off, we don't care""",2025-02-01 01:58:52
Oli H.,1,"Slow slow slow. Used to be so seemless and responsive. Now it is ridiculously slow in every aspect; starting up, loading, searching, playing, pausing. I even force closed the app and it still continued to play for >30 seconds. Tried all the usual things to resolve (logging out and in, restarting phone, redownloading, etc) all to no avail. Not a WiFi issue as other apps work fine and can use Spotify on Ipad with no issues.",2025-02-01 22:05:25
Lizzie R,3,"Getting super frustrated when coming to downloading podcasts. If you get into podcasts later on in its run, when there is plenty of backlog episodes to listen to, there is no option to download the whole lot *Update* Still super annoying to download a podcast's back catalogue or to redownload episodes after you've listened to them but it's pretty convenient to have all my music and podcasts in one place. My other complaint was just a user error so 🤷",2025-02-08 21:09:20
Mode,4,"I hate how the (+) button now adds the recommended songs to 'Liked Songs' instead of the last playlist I was listening to. Before, it automatically added them to the active playlist, but now I have to manually change it every time. This is frustrating, especially since my playlists are genre-based and the recommendations match them. I mostly listen when driving, so now I have to take my eyes off the road to do this. Please add an option in the settings to restore the previous behavior.",2025-02-28 09:36:07
Ognian N,1,"The app was working perfectly fine until a month ago or so, then it was completely broken. It is slow now, uses a ton of battery and, worst of all, it still uses up massive amounts of mobile data, even though I downloaded my podcasts on WiFi. This is unacceptable! Please test your new software versions before rolling them in. And also hire competent developers.",2025-02-28 14:23:29
Simon Russell,2,"I really dislike ""made for you"", and ""picked for you"". I only use Spotify for music. I have NO interest in podcasts, audiobooks, videos, etc. I just want MUSIC 🥺 Seriously hate the way Spotify is going. I just want a clean streaming music app. Please implement a way of disabling features, or to not show them, in the settings. Yes, I know I can ""dislike"", etc, but it doesn't go away. Just bloat after bloat, after bloat. I am thinking of dropping Spotify, as it's getting more and more bloated.",2025-02-28 14:32:53
Kimberly Villamor,1,"I LOVED Spotify, been using it for years because it's only the music app suitable for me. But the updates has been making me upset recently because of the limited skips. And now I can't even choose the songs I want to play?? I was confused when I was searching up a specific song and it wouldn't let me play it. Apparently, I've used all the freeplay or whatever up. I get ads almost every two songs and it kills the mood. I haven't gotten a verified money app so I can't buy premium either 💔",2025-01-18 12:00:24
Rid Sampurna,3,"Stop adding useless stuff and if you do add some ""new"" feature create a toggle to disable or enable it. For example: The useless and annoying ""Picked for you"" section is bugged, no matter how many time i dislike it it won't go away. It also ruins the aesthetic of the Homepage. I get it that you fire a lot of people recently but that is why you need to a toggle for any new feature especially if it's bugged.",2025-02-20 20:55:07
Tyler S,1,"Completely unnecessary to update the queue screen, looks no better and you've made it much less useful - i can no longer remove songs from the queue AT ALL, and to add a song to play next i have to search that specific song. It is so much harder now to use smoothly. Genuinely going to consider going to a different app if it isn't reverted",2025-01-14 16:00:23
Summer,2,"(Premium user)Kind of getting annoyed at the amount of bugs on this app, it never used to be like this a few years ago. Firstly the shuffle feature doesn't actually shuffle anymore and just plays the same songs I have thousands of songs on my liked playlist and probably only hear 50. Every time I press shuffle it plays the exact same song and then plays about 10 of the same songs in the same order every time. Spotify sort it out.",2025-01-24 17:25:07
Mobile Data,1,"God I wish Spotify changes. I've been running into problems after problems with this goddamn app! First you put shuffle behind a pay wall, then you give out limited skips, increase the ads between songs, and now I can't even access some of my songs?! No matter how many times I click on those songs, they REFUSE to play. What the hell happened, Spotify?? I do not recommend this to ANYONE.",2025-02-18 18:07:07
Stephanie Gregory,1,"The latest update has changed the queue functionality. Whereas before you could select multiple songs from the queue that you wanted to remove, you now have to swipe each song individually. However the swipe function is terrible and takes about 15 tries to get rid of the song!! I honestly don't understand why they have changed it. Is there a way to revert back to how it used to be?",2025-02-23 15:39:53
marko polo,3,Keep having an issue where it'll happily play the ads but then at the end of the ads it'll just refuse to continue playing songs. Causing me to need to close the app and play again and sometimes that doesn't even fix it and the play list will say it's playing but just not do that or even show at the bottom godknows why it's happening but it's not great. Edit: tried uninstalling and reinstalling and whilst it's lessened my original issues new ones have arose so yeah it's kinda janky atm,2025-01-09 19:06:39
Darren Bowen,5,"Brilliant application, also you save when you add more people to the plans . The world of music at your fingertips , one thing that could be improved is the search engine you have to be a bit too specific when searching for a song you can't remember .

Charley Pearce,1,"I have had Spotify since 2019 and the last few months it's been basically impossible to use, so glitchy and frustrating, I can't change my profile picture because it always says something went wrong, I can't shuffle my liked songs, it will take at least 30 seconds to load the first song and then to skip is a whole other battle, absolute garbage. Update: it's gotten to a point it doesn't even load my liked songs anymore, I am seriously considering going to YouTube music instead.",2025-02-13 06:29:49
Charles Renaud-Cordeau,1,"Love Spotify, its ease of use, making playlists, creating a jam, etc. App has great features, but for God's sake please let me shuffle my playlists. When hitting shuffle, the same 20-30 songs will play every single time, while the 800+ other songs in said playlists will only play once every few months. I listen to over 200K minutes of music per year, which places me in the top 0.1% of Spotify users worldwide and have this problem EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.",2025-02-17 17:38:46
Philip Kurgüen,1,"It's clear when an artist is paying Spotify to get their music recommended to you to an insulting degree and you have no way to block it or remove it from the homepage even as a paying user. Creating a playlist is a bit finicky, search is terrible unless you know exactly the name of the artist and the song, you can't add multiple songs from an album unless you do it one by one. It's awful. You have no control basically even if you pay.",2025-01-10 22:11:42
Anil Makadia,1,"I used to love Spotify, but the free version is now a disaster. Ads are constant and disruptive, interrupting my listening experience every 3-4 songs. The shuffle feature is a complete joke, playing the same songs over and over again. It's frustrating and makes the free version almost unusable. I'm seriously considering switching to a paid service or another platform altogether",2025-01-14 05:31:36
James Lamb,1,"Very poor user experience overall. I listen to podcasts while driving and to say that the experience is subpar would be too kind. There's no way to filter based on the podcast, time, genre of music while driving. From the end user perspective it looks like android auto is only added as a tickbox exercise and there's been little or no effort to develop a consistent experience with the mobile app. I could write a book on how poor the experience is, if spotify wants detailed feedback msg me.",2025-03-01 02:50:40
Caz Johnstone,4,"Overall very satisfied, with the one exception being that the app randomly deleted 75% of my liked songs for no apparent reason. I had many moons worth of favorites that I liked to peruse, and now I wander glossy-eyed through a dense forest of music that quickly passes me by like the gone-too-soon summer days of my childhood. Would still recommend this app with a premium account though...",2025-01-17 05:12:01
S J,1,"What is this Liked Songs folder doing in my playlists? Now, when I'm browsing through saved albums, every single track is ticked and entered in the Liked Songs playlist, so I can't pick out the tracks that I have saved in Playlists I've created.

igwe ofobike,1,"I'm just sick of the inconsistency of this app. You can't play songs sequentially from searched results, sometimes you just want to listen to a specific artist from liked songs without creating a list. 2, you can't enable a song to immediately play next, except being to added to an existing queue and it sits at the bottom of the queue, you don't have to drag a song for God's sake.

Phil W,3,like using the free app. let's of great music to look through and make Playlists from. not the biggest fan of only 6 skips per day. I know the free usage has draw backs but it was better with unlimited skips just more ad time between songs also having other songs being interjected in a Playlist that doesn't have any of the genre isn't always welcomed either,2025-01-18 19:31:04
Evan Merkley,1,"I am about done with this app, I dislike the fact that you only shuffle on free mode, but for the love of Christ, when I click into an album or play list id like to hear songs in that album and playlist before you go off into autoplay, and it shouldn't cost skips to get off a song that you didn't add to your playlist and plan to listen to, and please fix autoplay, it never plays music from artists I actually listen to or even close to the timeline I listen to, it just zones out into random stuff",2025-02-06 21:45:09

Cale Hatfield,2,All time price go up only get few feature Shuffle plays the same songs over and over again DJ plays the same songs over and over again Smart shuffle plays the same songs over and over again just paired with every song you have removed from your playlist in the past 2 years. There isn't a good way to actually find new music based on what I want to listen to and it's really just laziness because they already have the algorithm for it in suggested songs when you're making a playlist,2025-02-27 04:39:41
RosesBubble,1,"App keeps crashing when scrolling through my library, consistently. Edit: deleting cache and app data fixed this, purely because I realized the problem was a playlist containing songs from local files, which inexplicably cause spotify to crash when being played or even just by being on screen even when I deleted the files manually outside the app. It also caused me to have to redownload all my music from scratch to be able to play it offline, so it stays one star.",2025-02-25 23:27:54
Vyann Bajamundi,4,"It's a nice music player app, I use it 24/7. My favorite feature is definitely Spotify Wrapped, it's really fun!

Fiona Saxton,2,"All features very navigable, but the change to song queuing is a huge backwards step. It was hard enough to select songs without clicking on one, but now it's tedious as hell and inconvenient to try and curate a set of songs while having to remove or add them one by one.

Anders Iversen,1,"A horrible nightmare of an app to navigate through. Trying to actually look out and pick out a specific song to add to your playlist is just so inconvenient, confusing, unintuitive and badly designed. You look for a song but only get an album.

Flo Per,1,The new UI and presentation of the queue is abysmal and hideous and incredibly inconvenient. The recent update made is many times worse than the previous presentation. It looks like a bloody 16 year olds first attempt at designing an MP3 player. Why is it so difficult for companies to just accept that they have a good design and leave it be? App design bloody sucks and is very inconvenient,2025-02-17 21:33:01
Connor Rogers,3,"Auto playing videos of sports betting podcasts on the home feed is incredibly disappointing, with no way to hide them.

Highly recommend it to everyone!",2025-01-11 12:47:17
Tara Cartwright,2,"Been using Spotify for years, and I absolutely love it. My main problem is that as a casual listener, I don't want to pay to be ad free when I only listen for short time periods. Another thing is, it often lags, and recently I haven't been able to listen to anny podcasts, the app say they aren't available? Really wish these weren't such big issues.

Jvee Angelo Dizon,1,"Dear Spotify Team I wanted to share my frustration about the recent update that limits free users to only 6 skips per hour and requires Premium just to change songs.

Ririka,2,Spotify does have basically every song but I hate every little thing they added to the free version. It's like they give you a month free then they do every little thing to annoy you.

I shouldn’t have to waste time making separate playlists for every artist.",2025-02-20 13:05:57
Advaita Iyer,1,"Everything needs premium now. You can't choose songs much, switch to a certain part in the play bar, or skip songs unless you have premium. Lyrics mostly aren't even there. Even shuffling isn't good. Even the ads don't give you the ""thirty minute ad free"" listening like they promise. It doesn't even do the basic function of PLAYING THE SONGS YOU WANT. (Not without 1000000 long ads on why premium is so ""good"") It used to be so amazing. Now it just sucks.",2025-01-17 14:28:25

Nelson,1,"I pay for the app but still gets ads in various spammy formats, many of which cannot be disabled. Even if you disable them all they'll add a new one in a months time! Disgusting. The only reason I'm still using this app is because it knows my discover weekly preferences. The second a competitor can match Spotify's algorithm I'm jumping ship. Frankly that's probably going to be later this week, I've been putting up with this for years and am out of patience.",2025-01-17 12:24:54
Matthew,1,"Too many ads and can't justify 15/mth to be rid of them 🤷 maybe 5/mth would suit better. I don't mind ads but the frequency and length of them not to mention the amount of dead space in the ads (30sec ad with a 15-20sec read), really turns me off using Spotify daily. Only use it for long trips and even then having to listen to 3x30sec ads every 2 or 3 songs is too much after a short while. WHY ARE ADS DOUBLE THE VOLUME!! Having to drop the volume every time an ad comes up is stupid! FIX IT!",2025-02-22 23:44:33

Sera Ranjith,3,"Spotify is great I love the suggestions of music and the playlists made ,all of them match my taste .But ads they appear again and again & it's new updations make me sick we cannot skip songs more than 6 times a day and once you skip 6 times you cannot choose to play the song you like ,you will have to listen to the song it plays whether you like it or not 😠 Spotify fix this prob as fast as possible cause we have downloaded the app to listen to the songs we like and not what you want to play.",2025-03-26 06:58:41
jeffrey hornblower,1,The new free update sucks imagine only letting you users skip 6 songs a day and not ever choose the songs you want to listen too you gotta just let it go on shuffle mode. predatory monetization.i might as well just look up the songs I want to listen to on YouTube at this rate. Who ever thought of this should genuinely be fired cause this is just gate keeping telling me what song I HAVE to listen even tho I don't want to cause I used all my skips and can't chose my songs.,2025-02-20 03:55:33
Pratham Sharma,1,"It was a really good app. Now all the features are transferred to premium. You can not play the previous song without premium, can't read lyrics, cannot repeat songs, cannot play in custom order. Let's not talk about ads for now. Really bad update. If there was something lower than 1 star, I would've rated that",2025-02-22 05:31:07
Lazar Racić,5,"I am not a premium user, but the app is amazing. People say like you can't skip more than 6 times and hour or you can't play music that you want, or they hate the shuffle. Boo-hoo, no one cares, get premium then🤣 But there is one problem. The app couldn't continue playing the songs from the playlist for some reason, I fixed it by just reinstalling the app. The issue comes when you run out of skips and then it doesn't know what to do for some reason, I think. Hope this review helps!",2025-03-18 08:12:23
Vimlesh Kumar,2,"Dear Spotify Team, Thank you for creating such an amazing platform! I love the user-friendly design, great audio quality, and diverse music library. However, I feel the limitations on free users, like frequent ads, can disrupt the experience. Offering more flexible plans could help bridge the gap. Overall, Spotify is my favorite music app, and I appreciate your efforts to improve and listen to user feedback. Best regards, By an, { Old user 👤 }.",2025-01-23 18:13:20
Den Asc,1,"My playlist disappeared after my account was disabled after the last update and the subscription for 2 months was removed. I can't subscribe again for a 2-months trial because I did it once, but in fact I didn't even used the app for 2 months !! Shame on you! Contacted the support ! Issues solved",2025-02-28 16:32:23
Anita Dutta.,1,"The amount of begging I had experienced from this app. Like really, no other app, I think can compete in playing broke more than this app. Surrendered, really. Suggesting to explore premium was bearable to some extent until one day I find out, you can even play a song after searching it on the search bar too! Like.... I have really no words for this app... Really.",2025-02-07 14:10:36
Mohammed Fayiz Ferosh,1,"Spotify free unusable no rewind, fast forward or queueing song. Also now if we click on name of song we can't play it, we have to literally open the song album and find play button and click it, even if we do that only first song in album plays and we have to skip to the song we need. Also current song suggetions are very bad not at all to my taste. Earlier I had plans of taking Spotify premium when I'm intensively using Spotify, but now I don't want to.",2025-02-06 09:15:13
Arijith C Vagish,1,"Tooo many ads i mean i know i have to pay to get rid of em. But the problem is when i watch an ad and it says enjoy 30mins ad free, i still get 2-3 ads in between! This happened so many times and its kinda annoying! *Udapte* I just got about another 6 ads!!!! 6 ads!!!!! Even aftwr watching that ""get 30 mins ad free"" nonsense! Great works!!!!! Y the hell should we pay to turn off shuffle mode and to activate the play previous song button????",2025-03-27 19:19:50
Chirag Malaviya,2,"I would like to say that spotify is getting worse time to time because we have to listen the most disturbing ads after every 2 or 3 songs and unlike the old spotify, they have now added the limits for the songs, after the limit is reached, we cannot choose the songs which we want to play and listen, it's the worst thing ever. They each and every time show us ads to buy the premium, but we don't want to pay money for just listening so why are you forcing to do such things that we don't want to?",2025-01-26 18:22:23
Daniel Nkoane,5,"This app is the best music app. But one thing, The Premium adverts try so hard to get you to pay monthly when you don't want no Premium for a month. (I'm using the app while typing here). Anyway, unlike YouTube Music, when you go off the app, the music still plays, and you can make your own Playlist, Spotify can also find any song you want! 🤩💫💫💫💫💫 5 stars!",2025-02-15 08:50:28
Priyashna Sharma,1,"Worst app, I asked for my refund 3 months ago and they said it's been refunded but I still haven't received it . I asked the payment providers and everyone but they said it's not been refunded. Spotify said it has but I haven't received it and when I asked them the proof they showed only the Spotify transaction details but not the actual screenshot or anything that says the payment is confirmed. They are also very rude and don't reply!",2025-03-23 16:06:26
Samara,2,"My gosh... this app is something else on a negative level. Whenever i try to listen to a playlist or 1 specific song, it always gives the ""recommended"" songs? Therefore i can never listen to the songs i actually WANT to listen which is an actual pain. Fix this please- i wanna listen to ENHYPEN without a different artist coming on.",2025-03-04 22:59:48
Gökhan Solak,1,"Gets worse and worse by time, software usability wise. Most annoying ones: - Switches randomly to phone while listening on PC - default shortcut shall be moving 15 sec back/forth a podcast episode, not skipping the whole episode (at least put an option) - keeps recommending podcast channels I only ever listened to once, and keep marking as not interested",2025-03-12 10:53:33
Ambur wilks,2,Terrible app. Overrated and glazed. Press play on my music and instead of listening to the artist I played it's seven ads followed by some middle aged man telling you to do a survey. Ads and survey talk over and your music plays. Hurray! Little happy moment then you realise it's not what you wanted at all. It's some random 12 year old kid screaming in your ear calling it music. Don't get me STARTED on the amount I have to pay for premium. Spotify is an overrated and money hungry app. Fix it.,2025-03-14 18:26:02
Idan Badishi,5,"You know what? After checking out Tidal again, I have to say that—even though it offers lossless audio—nothing compares to Spotify's efficiency and convenience. While I do wish Spotify had a lossless option, I can’t help but appreciate the quality of the user experience.",2025-03-20 14:17:12
Michael Woodward,1,"When you are out of data, this app is very buggy and slow, it is so desperate to connect to the internet even if you have podcasts or songs downloaded. Terribly slow to play, it won't navigate, won't even play a song or podcast that is already halfway through from a previous session if you open without internet.",2025-02-26 07:00:33
Jakub Groman,2,"Randomly shutting down; inconsistent way of adding songs to queue; can't remove individual songs from queue; doesn't load without internet; some blends never refresh; useless features get added and app keeps getting more bloated (videos, editor picks, local top hits. Why?); cannot search for facebook friends; setting ""Do not play"" on author prevents me from playing them even when I go to their profile myself. Would appreciate a way to discover songs from authors I already liked.",2025-02-13 11:18:05
Ranajoy Dutta,1,"Finally, after years of use with and without premium, now its time to say good bye to Spotify. Their greed is too high. First ads, then no skips, no shuffles or queues and Now I cant even play the song I want without paying. Its about such culture of malpractices that further discourages me from paying. Please don't fool people by stating this app as free. This is a fully paid app now. Time to switch to youtube or something else for better environment.",2025-02-04 07:46:11
Bold Stroke,1,"The new update to this app is very disappointing. Almost everything needs premium subscription like can't we even listen to the song we want to from any part?? Can't we listen to our own created playlist in order?? This app is crapp. I want tge developers to remove this thing, it's very much annoying and frustrating to many users.",2025-01-11 08:34:23
Timur Son,1,Worst music app. I can't even pick which songs I want to play. I have to listen to the entire album until the song that I want will play. And I can't even listen to the same song again on repeat. And no controlling the song itself. Can't go back to the previous song that played. And pls get rid of ai search.,2025-02-28 10:30:48
Lulu,1,"its nice to listen to the music BUT... spotify says that you get ""30 minutes without ads"" and sometimes i get an ad after every song. and the ads ruin the mood. NO, the ads dont make us feel like ""oh i got an ad, i need to buy premium!"". instead it makes us feel like ""AGAIN!? AN AD? im definetly not buying premium if you arent even going to treat me a bit well when im just a normal user.""",2025-03-22 16:09:51
Ethan Rai,4,"To many adds, play the same songs over and over even if you just stop the app for 10 minutes it will play the same songs just played😥. In saying all that I still love this for all the music choice and easy setup for different play lists and great sound quality.",2025-03-04 06:48:52
Elli Wrth,3,"I paid for premium, thats already too much to be honest but if I'm paying for something I expect it to genuinely work but no it doesn't.

Axel Kittendragon,2,"Not worth it. It has a great selection of music, but basic functions cost money for premium. You only get a few skips an hour, and they say you get 30 minutes of no ads - just to get an ad in the next one or two songs. 90% ads and 10% music unless you pay them.",2025-03-09 15:43:17
ashvini vidhate,2,"This app is very cool and I love listening to music,but the think I hate is that after a while,this dosent let you play the songs you want and forces you to listen the recommendations EVEN THOUGH WE DONT WANT TO! And it also forces us to have spotify premium or we would be forced to listen to the songs they reccomend and not be able to listen to a specific part of a song. They just want money nothing else 😠",2025-03-20 08:30:18
J M,1,Whoever is responsible for this redesign should be fired. Congratulations I thought Spotify had become an essential for me but it looks like you could still screw it up enough for me to replace it. Although I was using a modded APK for years so who knows when they actually changed it to this dreck. Bye bye Spotify. You can Spotify wrap yourself in a rug and roll yourself off a pier next time.,2025-03-10 12:02:44
Paul Sturgess,3,"Great app when it works, currently using free version due to affordability. Only issue is after listening to almost every advert it says ""now enjoy the next 30 mins advert free"" and I think yay!! Well, after each song I get 3 or 4 adverts!!!!!

Louay Suuu,4,if your looking for the best experience it's better to pay but if you don't have enough money or your a minor you can use the free version but it'll be annoying like ads popping up and when you play a song sometimes it plays another song before the one you wanted and same goes to downloading songs you need to pay but overall this app is actually amazing for music i recommend paying for premium for the best experience if i even buy premium I'll change my ratings to 5 stars,2025-03-20 21:48:02
Aleksandar Miljic,1,"Not that good! The Algorithm is just really bad,plays me the exact same songs every day although it's supposed to be random and at least in similar genre.

London Citizen,3,"They do work on bugs that pop up but some can be real annoying. For example the bug I'm dealing with is the ""update your payment method"" any time I open the app. The problem is I canceled my membership before this happens from the web domain. There should be no need for me to update my payment method because there currently are no payments needed to be paid. Last bug was an audio glitch that would cause the app to play even when fully closed. Hopefully they will fix the payment one soon it's bad",2025-01-24 15:39:02
N McDermott,3,"(2017) It's great but the fact that you can't listen to an album without it suggesting every song the artist/band has ever made on the free account is annoying. (2021 till today) I now have the premium but my point still stands that you should be able to listen to an album without Spotify inputting other songs, the ads are bad enough so my rating won't change even though the personalisation is pretty amazing.",2025-02-18 14:50:36
Priyanka Suman,1,"The app was really good previously but the new update has made it worse. It takes the basic features of a music app like even the option to skip, rewind and choose a song to hear.

Willie B. Hardigan,1,Their most recent update they clearly added some Spyware to their app. It now uses 3 times the about of battery power so something extra is running in the background to syck your battery life. Probably running trackers to monitor everything you listen to. I used to listen to Spotify for 12 hrs and still have 50% battery. After the update I listen for 6 hours and have 10% . Spotify is hiding something running in the background in their app,2025-03-10 20:16:39
Morgan,5,I love this app. don't get why they want you to get premium because as long as u like all the songs on your playlist its not a big deal. Spotify gives you song recommed songs that you many like or not. It also has audiobooks and podcasts. personlly haven't listen to a podcast but hey you might enjoy that. the audiobooks are amazing though. I love them soo much. As a whole spotify is great try it and see for yourself!,2025-03-04 03:50:36

Fabian Naveen,5,"I've used this app for 13 years, and it's the best music app out of all of them. Highly recommend! Edit: Why did the ""search in your library"" feature changed.

Now, it shuffles through my library playlist instead of the searched songs. It's a bummer!",2025-03-03 05:42:37
Hardik Gothwal,1,"Horrible. Everytime when I play the app in background, after 1 or 1.5 minutes or so, the song suddenly stops. Then I have to switch to the app to replay the song from beginning.
