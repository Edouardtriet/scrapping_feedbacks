Willem van Heerden,1,"A couple of annoying bugs have crept in recently, and it's impossible to report these problems. This is unacceptable for such a widely used app. On the Pixel Watch 3 one can choose to not receive notifications while the phone is open. This works in every app except WhatsApp, meaning that the watch vibrates with every message received, even as I'm replying to them. Annoying and a massive battery drain. Why is it so hard to report bugs?",2025-03-12 18:48:19
Mike Moritz,1,"Updates always break functionality while adding ""features"" nobody asked for. Updated Feb2025. WA now opens a menu of file types when attaching something. Before you could just pick what you wanted. It doesn't display all my albums when sending pics. Long pressing the ""gallery"" file type opens my photo gallery but it's buggy and slower and doesn't display mp4 or all of my gifs like it did before. I now have to share my files from my gallery app to WA as a work-around. I dread their updates.",2025-02-19 17:05:38
Oscar Q,1,"I was really hoping for a smooth messaging experience, but WhatsApp has been a letdown. The app frequently crashes and the notifications are inconsistent, which makes it frustrating to keep up with conversations. Plus, the user interface can feel cluttered at times. I also have concerns about privacy and data security. Overall, I expected more from such a popular app. Time to look for alternatives",2025-01-18 09:17:05
A Google user,2,"I noticed that recently after updates, when listening to voice notes, if it's a long voice note the voice note will stop when the screen goes off. Dunno why it's doing this. Before it wasn't like that. Also noticed that missed calls are not shown on screen, but only when you open WA and check you chats you will see the missed call label inside the chat. Please work on a feature that allows you to block Whatsapp video/ calls in general or for a scheduled time.",2024-11-25 13:53:54
zahra,2,Love WhatsApp but there is a glitch that is very annoying. When I scroll ust a little bit up it jumps up hours earlier randomly. It happens very often and is confusing and annoying. Please look into this! Also please have a feature to disable or lock the video message feature because when scrolling it gets clicked on accident and is very annoying,2024-10-26 15:29:40
hu trillz,4,"Just started using the app and I'd happily give 5 stars if it were solely based on the product's simplicity design, and operating abilities, however I'd like to make 2 (obvious) suggestions. 1. Being a translate feature and perhaps have in settings a setting to set your preferred translating language. Also, on the topic, many prominent websites are offering live video call translating capabilities, might be worth considering. 2. A more clear account/profile accessibility button/page/feature.",2024-12-07 09:48:36
astroturtle,1,"FIX THE BUG THAT FORGETS YOUR LOGIN AND FORCES YOU TO RESTORE EVERYTHING. On every device, ""You have been logged out"" without ANY reason. And how is it possible to have WhatsApp set to ""daily"" backups, and then the most recent backup is from over a month ago? A month of messages, images, docs, videos, just gone because your app can't even do a BASIC BACKUP properly. Garbage app. The only reason I keep using this thing is because other people.",2024-12-21 19:55:22
Denise Martinez,2,"Fix This Bug: Having issues with accessing the gallery on my phone. App has access, but my albums do not show up in the option to send photos. Can't see all my photo/video albums Currently, when I try to share a picture or video on WhatsApp directly, it doesn't let me see all my folders. Many other users are having the same issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times.",2025-01-16 10:37:08
Alexius Emejom,4,"Very easy-to-use UI. I am not a fan of the latest updates to the Status updates interface that is displayed horizontally. I prefer the original vertical display for the status updates. I wish WhatsApp could revert to that view. Also, maybe the communities could be organized on another tab to free up space for status updates.",2024-09-28 14:43:29
Kaveen Amarasekara (ARMKT),4,"Thrilled to say this is has become my primary chat app for years. Recently, it has developed and improved a lot. New features, new experiences. The UI/UX is getting changed everyday. Yeah, overall experience is good. But, I have some complaints/ suggestions too. Most of the times when I open the app, it's look kinda mess. All the direct and group chats in the same interface so looks weird. So, first I suggest you to separate these to into two in the same page using tabs or whatever.",2025-03-14 04:42:05
K R,2,whoever had the idea to change the sound output from speaker mode to call mode anytime the camera was covered was severely misinformed. this is an incredibly annoying feature. I have to restart voice notes anytime a shadow crosses my camera. Anytime i put my phone in my pocket. and there is no way to turn this feature off. remove this feature--it's incredibly inconvenient and it makes an already kind of clunky app way way worse. on top of all that they track your data and use it for ads. fun.,2025-03-23 20:40:44
Elizabeth Moore,1,"not intuitive at all. I absolutely hate this app, and the fact everyone else uses it forces me to for work and family. Auto saves everything to my phone, filling it- if I delete it from my phone- it deletes it from the actual conversation screwing me up for work. i can no longer separate the two. won't save, open, or download properly on my computer. If it does open a video- now it's on repeat in the background even if i close it. won't let me share larger videos anymore. I hate this BS.",2025-04-01 19:06:45
Ron Beach,1,"Installed the app and just set up an account but did not use it at all. 3 hours later the account was blocked and when I attempt to send a review request it just says ""something went wrong ease try again."" Tried to reinstall but nothing changes. Triex to contact customer service but I just get a bot that goes in circles. Not a good experience. Still have not been able to send or receive anything.",2025-03-11 00:15:56
Jagan Krishnamurthy,1,"Whatsapp just crashes when I open one specific chat, without any error or warning message. The same chat opens fine in web and watch. It's the frequently used chat and I cannot delete the whole chat to clear the issue. A fix is needed ASAP. p.s - solution found in Reddit. click the profile icon of the misbehaving chat conversation, click on ""i"" button and change the ringtone.",2025-04-01 23:47:03
Clif Jackson,4,Works great only don't think that is what's app or even your internet that's causing you're connection to be slow or be dropped... It's very much got too do with your actual phones intenna more than anything else I wanna say... So if it's been over 6 months since you've bought or upgraded... Then your gonna have issues.. Once again not the actual app or your internet provider but your phone that's a POS. Almost like they made them to do that before long??? App works great overall!!!!,2025-03-07 14:58:56
Gloria Harris,4,"This application is exceptional; I commend the robust encryption and security measures protecting all conversations. The only area for improvement in the latest version is the unintended alteration of my avatar, resulting in an unsatisfactory visual representation. However, overall, I am highly satisfied and wholeheartedly recommend this application.",2025-03-30 21:25:00
G R,4,"Becoming cluttered. Still good UI. Calls are pretty reliable. Like that you can send/receive pictures and files. Unfortunately, they continue display all landline & toll-free numbers in your Whatsapp phone book with an ""Invite a Friend"" link. Even if already listed as whatsapp users. NO WAY to hide/remove. Meta trying hard to get you to invite everyone to use whatsapp. Wish I could hide the Channels option. If I wanted Facebook, I would have installed it on my phone!",2025-03-20 16:58:42
Emmanuel Mokwena,4,"I didn't give 5 stars for one reason. When I try to use the app in landscape mode, it is always glitchy and barely works. But other than that, I'm fully satisfied. Edit: Now there is another issue, there is a new list feature that was released a few weeks ago. I only had it for about a week, and it was gone. I tried restarting my WhatsApp, deleting it, and installing it again. Nothing worked. If this could be resolved,I would appreciate it.",2025-03-19 17:25:27
Scott,5,"User friendly. The UI is clean and it's easy to communicate with people and share files. For privacy it does it's job good enough. It has end-end encryption and allows a p2p connection with another. A reminder that this app itself can and may store data, metadata, messages, and files regarding your use. The developer has to abide by the law in order to continue to be sustainable. Personally, I wouldn't use it to share sensitive data. I would use another layer of pgp or an Open GNU program.",2025-03-16 16:38:16
Karl Madison,1,"forced updates. after being forced to update, haven't been getting notifications the past month or two. doesn't allow editing messages after a few minutes. doesn't allow deleting messages after a short time. I don't want to use timed messages, I want to individually delete any messages from both receiver and sender at will. can't edit or delete history. telegram is better in every way.",2025-03-24 16:06:33
Sarah Estes,1,"I have been trying to get my account unlocked after it was (as admitted through the review) mistakenly marked as spam. Yet it has been over 24 hours and I can't even login. I was given no warning, suddenly a message just appeared saying I wasn't allowed access. I've tried multiple times to get in touch. The one time a call actually came it hung up before giving me the verification code. You made a mistake, you need to fix whatever is going on",2025-03-08 17:50:13
Anu A,1,"Voice Message stops on its own after few seconds. I pressed the Voice message button and I was going on and on, only to find out the recording had stopped on it's own after few seconds, thought it was my fault and started over again, and again, and again!!! this problem has been going on for weeks now.",2025-03-28 05:02:53
Ruben Sanchez Gonzalez,2,"Since meta bought this app, it has been declining both in quality and functionality. Vocie messages. If you leave a draft, a lot of times you'll lose your message. If you pause while recording a voice note, it stops preventing the screen from turning off, so it interrupts your message. Is there are 2 or more voice notes to be played, you can't just play one, leave the app to do something else, and keep auto play the rest. It just stops. All in all, quality worsening each day.",2025-02-27 02:28:22
Henry Ofori,4,"WhatsApp Messenger is good 👍🏼 for communication from all locations. It helps to forward images, files, documents, and other links to help reach more people and set plans for your support. The main difficulty it shows when making a call is: ""connecting/reconnecting"", which I think is from the network. When this statement shows no voices are heard 😒, either you called or you're receiving a call from others. It's great 👍🏼 in sharing current status and chatting with families and friends 🧡.",2025-01-31 15:01:01
Sean,1,"Jesus christ, app developers: stop changing things people use every day for no good reason. Don't move the button to attach photos from the gallery to the opposite side of the screen, so now I reflexively keep hitting ""attach location"" or whatever. Don't make it so the slider sometimes refuses to appear and I can't quickly scroll back through photos from a long time ago. It worked fine. Leave it alone.",2025-02-25 04:23:35
Corey Hernandez (Parkorey),2,"Have been using app for years. It was fantastic initially, but lately the quality of the app has gone way down. Calls have been dropping more and more frequently. Video quality has become very pixelated. App has been glitching and saying I decline peoples calls when I never declined them, most times phone won't even ring and I'll have half a dozen missed calls all arrive at once. Shame, was a great app for a while. Hopefully they can fix all these glitches, but it's been like this for months.",2025-03-01 23:18:08
kevin whisenant,1,"Unfortunately, I can't send msgs from my watch. I receive them fine but when I reply, they're stuck pending with the clock icon. They'll only send if I force close the app and open it up again. But lately that hasn't been working either. Loading voice msgs often times gets stuck spinning and never loads. I have the LTE version and everything else works fine. No issues on my phone. This happens whether I'm on WiFi or LTE. I've tried uninstalling, restarting, force closing. Nothing fixes it.",2025-02-15 15:11:47
Mwape Chimpampa,4,"I really like the app. It makes things so easy. But I still have some suggestions, not really complaints. I really think that it would be good for a feature to be added for people to copy the text on their status post, so that if they typed anything wrong, they can copy, delete, paste and make the minor edits needed instead of typing everything all over again. And if another feature to allow one to change to view once anything they forgot to send as a view once by a simple tap, that would be 👍",2025-02-09 11:25:09
Connor Hawke,1,"Gone. WhatsApp suddenly lost all my messages. It wasn't even open. One day I opened the app and it said it would try to restore my chat history from backup. It failed. Many others have had the same issue; search Google. The fix to get some (but probably not all) of your data back is long-winded and may require rooting your phone. I'm no longer using WhatsApp. Also: critical bugs on Android, including missing messages/media in exports. Customer service is either AI or illiterate. Use another app.",2025-02-07 03:30:05
Roman Abreu,1,"There's a very annoying voice messaging bug that has been going on for months where for some reason the volume is so low that even at max volume you can barely hear them. Initially I thought it was my current phone but recently I've received voice notes from iPhone users with the exact same issue, and it's not only annoying but dangerous as sometimes one can forget to lower the volume before playing something else. Please fix it!!",2025-02-14 00:29:41
Yoel Teitelbaum,1,"This is the worst app when it comes to switching devices. There is no one to talk to except an AI that keeps repeating the same useless response over and over. It's a shame that, in this day and age, the process is so complicated, takes so long, and still ends up failing. It's time for real investors to take over and fix it."" my advice if you need this for business don't touch it use some alternative messaging services there are plenty out there",2025-02-20 20:41:23
Michael Eiland,2,"Very unhappy. For some reason when choosing a picture to send in a message, of all my albums in my gallery, only 5 are visible to select from. This was never the case before up till now. I only can select pictures from camera folder, recents folder, downloads folder, whatsapp and screenshot folders. If I click the 3 buttons top right only cloud apps is there. This means if I have a picture in another folder I have to transfer it to one of these to be able to send it in whatsapp. Permission on",2025-01-28 03:43:17
Heather Strojan,3,"why don't the GIFs work. They don't continue to run at all in fact they stop quicker then ever, press play and stops. Every other app I have the GIFs never stop which I the whole point of even using them. also now I can't tell if someone is recording a voice message at the top when in the message, it's now a microphone 🎤 at the bottom. stop changing things",2025-03-25 20:34:49
Nils M,2,"The photos sent from this app keep saving on my gallery. It's a nuisance. I have to keep manually deleting them. To add to this nuisance, the app keeps asking about saving to Google drive or something else. Why not save in a temporary app folder like most apps do? Or at least make that an option... I literally loathe opening this app, and I loathe getting memes. I use the app cuz some family and friends overseas are on it, I wish they were on some of the other better communications apps.",2025-01-29 15:54:50
Anthony Thornton,1,"Whatsapp pushed some update making a lot of phones incompatible with the app. Can no longer add contacts, sync contacts, scan contacts with QR codes, or provide QR codes.

Also, sometimes will get disconnected and de-registered and will have to make new account.",2025-03-16 06:24:02
Dino Bettini,2,"They removed the ""show notifications"" option when muting a group. This is such a downgrade. Also, the limits to sharing and forwarding messages are horrible. Edit: Also, similar to Instagram, their features are so full of bugs that it seems only interns work on them. Restoring the chat history on another phone always fails after getting to 97%. Lost an entire day trying it.",2025-03-02 20:22:47
Leanne Brereton,1,"Stop messing with this app. Changing things around every 5 minutes and every time you do it goes worse. Can't access my full SD Card now. Only recents, camera, screenshots and downloads are available. I want access to ALL my photos and folders not just the ones you recommend. Click on see more and it brings up the exact same folders so how is this ""more""? Also keeps crashing and booting me out half way through typing.

Sandy bind,3,"For what I use it for at work, the app works fine. But when I had a problem with my number being banned after I tried to move it to a new phone, I got no response from Whatsapp. So gave up and adjusted at work. But on a whim I tried to download the app again after a month and a half...and it downloaded and works just fine. So...the app is fine as long as you don't have a problem! And just maybe, if you give it time, your account will reset.",2025-03-05 19:17:13
Tori McDowell,1,"If I could give WhatsApp zero stars, I would. The app is full of issues that never get fixed. It crashes constantly, the notifications don’t work properly, and messages often don’t send or arrive late. The interface is clunky, and it’s impossible to find old chats easily. Group chats are a nightmare with endless spam, and you can't even mute certain contacts without them still showing up.",2025-01-19 04:15:18
Nick Noyce,4,"the perfect replacement for SMS! The only annoying thing is the lack of any kind of housekeeping function, I'd like an option to be able to clear down old chats to keep most recent chats, to do this manually would take ages, my backup size is large because of this but I don't want to clear whole entire chats as I like to have at least the last few months to refer back to.",2025-02-25 09:20:00

Lucius I.,1,"Beware! Please read! I recently noticed pictures that I did not download on my phone- lots. I thought that maybe I had synced my account with my daughter's. Nope. So I researched it. Turns out apps can download stuff onto your phone. WhatsApp has been not only downloading pictures to my phone but accessing my contacts, my music and audio, and my phone calls in the last 24 hours.

A Google user,2,I've been a staunch supporter of WhatsApp for many years but since one of the latest updates when I try to take a picture and zoom in to the max it automatically switches to that dreaded video note. I can't understand the point of it anyway. When I want to shoot a video I use the normal one. Why do I need that silly little circle but most to the point why does it switch to that when I'm just trying to take a closeup picture? Until you fix it I'm only giving you 2 stars 🙄,2025-02-06 03:18:10
Lisa Tibbitts,3,I have enjoyed using this app but I want the option to delete anything I've shared for everyone whenever the need arises. I am using it to get to know possible romantic partners but after talking and sending videos and photos (nothing r rated) I don't want them having access once we stop talking. That seems reasonable to me. Even harmless photos and videos can be misused when things are complicated and end.,2025-02-02 19:32:28

You have to give out your phone number to use it; so the only reason to use this app instead of texting, is that you can message people in other countries without international charges.

Swati Patil,3,Edit- Grateful for multiple accounts and lists. Have one more request..Would like to open WhatsApp with one of the lists I prefer on screen and not all chats as default. App is good.

Danish Siddique,1,"Hello, the latest WhatsApp update has introduced changes that I find quite inconvenient. Earlier, status updates were displayed in a straightforward vertical list, which I preferred. Now, they’re arranged in a horizontal format, which feels less user-friendly. Additionally, the Updates tab is now filled with channels and their options, which I don’t find useful. The previous design was simpler and more practical.

vintage rain,3,The new update changing things with the ui makee the app more difficult and annoying to use. The format and shape of things does not have to be changed. Today I saw the gallery option only accessing a very small number of my photos making it much more difficult to access and send specific images. I hope the ui goes back to the previous one because it worked much better.,2024-12-23 21:54:16
ryu,1,"once again, i don't understand the unnecessary need to modernise and change everything in this app. the newest update changes the ""typing..."" feature into a text bubble instead, which was, AGAIN, completely unnecessary & looks off. why change something that worked perfectly fine before? features like this should be optional, as not everyone copes well with change. PLEASE have more regard for your users, if it's not broken stop fixing it. as soon as you get used to a layout, they change it AGAIN.",2024-12-04 17:27:12
Danish Syah,2,"Emoji button is gone from the text status option. Why is that this app's update always makes it worse than before. I get that you did make an improvement (unnoticeable as always), but the things that has been removed or changed not to the users liking always sticks out the most. And one more thing. The web version should at least make text status. People who works 24/7 on their PC might need to use that anyway. And now somehow my contact isn't linked to this app",2025-01-20 14:19:26
Anthony Thompson,2,"You guys should have fixed the hanging issue on android by now. It freezes or doesn't respond when I want to take screenshot, I just missed two important calls. The android system basically freezes when using WhatsApp. I dont know if it's a samsung only issue or all android. Cus my friends who has the same issue are all using samsung. It's been almost a year if not more and still hasn't been rectified. I was forced to come here to complain. It's really frustrating.",2024-11-06 09:34:28
Ilari Welling,1,"Meta have managed to ruin the app in the latest updates. What was simple, like adding pictures, is now a complex annoyance as editing them and the text added to them has been made more difficult, and the functionality is simply annoying. They have tried to improve something that didn't even need improving, and in doing so, have made it so much worse. At least there are other apps to migrate to, I will suggest that if this is not rolled back.",2025-01-01 08:59:31
Mustafa Shararah,1,"The addition of the voice chat option in group chats without a way to disable it or move it anywhere else on the screen is truly astonishing. It replaces a fundamental (scroll to the bottom feature) area, that should be empty when reading recent chat, because now it covers the two-ticks as well, and is just above the send button so it's accidentally hit multiple times. Give us an option to disable this feature and to disable meta AI when trying to tag users. All we need is a disable option.",2024-12-05 07:26:11
Charles Morris,3,"Love being able to download voice notes and listen during a hike without my phone. However, playback stops usually 5 mins in unless I switch focus to the app. Playback position is lost - wish there was a way to seek even if rough. Also can't seem to download voice notes longer than 30 mins or so, it just spins endlessly even in WiFi.",2024-12-12 05:52:51
Jeremy “AshReal” Spencer,2,"(edited) thanks WhatsApp! I only have one more conplain. Unlike Iphone, WA here doesn't have the feature to preview the cut part on Status. Preview as in hovering the ""start"" or ""end"" part of the video and we can see which or what happen at the part we're about to cut off or end at(same goes with start). This will helps a lot on posting a precise short videos or clips without having to rewatch the vids from the beginning. Edited: now my animated stickers won't animating. Fix this asap",2024-10-19 09:11:42
Eugene Chinemelum,1,"I was complaining about arranging people's status in the order of time of posting. Now, posting or sharing photos or videos on status or to contacts is now a war. I thought it was network challenge, but it's not it. This is really really challenging. How can 1 photo load for almost 2 minutes.. These are so bad... Other features are improving though..",2024-12-16 18:34:37
Daniel Osawaru,5,"19th/11/24 The app has been going through some changes the past few months with some good and some very questionable. AI, drafts, and other good features where added but please make it easier to navigate the status page, just take it back to how it used to look where everything was vertical and not horizontal. Thank you",2024-11-19 17:44:17
Levi Zammit,1,"Please fix your Bluetooth issue for playback of audio messages. I cannot play audio messages unless I have some other music playing, in which case it speaks over the music which is annoying. If I pause the music the message appears to be playing and no sound comes out. This only happens when connected to a Bluetooth device IE car or headphones. I have a pixel 7 Pro with all recent/relevant updates to app and OS.",2024-12-30 06:17:34
Madhumanti Nath,3,"I have been unable to back up my chats since 18th April. The backup size also keeps increasing everytime I start it anew, and it has currently reached 1.1 gb. My Google account has auto-sync turned on, whatsapp is fully updated too. The bar stays full at 100% for hours, but the backup never uploads, with a message showing ""Google storage experiencing issues"" when it stops. I have done the recommended procedures in the app, but nothing is helping. Please look into this matter. Edit: Same again",2024-12-12 02:29:02
Jasmine Green Tea,1,"I'll edit my rating once my issue has been resolved. Currently for my WhatsApp, all the emojis are missing. When I open up the emojis menu, it just says ""No emoji found. Try searching with different text"". But the thing is, I did not even type anything to search for a specific emoji. The whole menu is missing.. Now, my only way to type emojis are through my phone's keyboard.",2025-01-17 01:14:46
Asemahle Hlabahlaba,4,"The app is great but then the problem comes at the statuses. When ever I send a picture or especially videos, WhatsApp completely changes the quality of the video and it's really irritating and annoying. I don't care about any changes WhatsApp makes but all I ask for is the ability to send videos in their original quality .😐😊. A new feature that must added is that we can now react to statuses. I mean like... HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE!!",2024-11-07 19:21:08

Travel to Paddle,1,"Getting worse and they don't care. I woke up to find my account with all chats and media gone forever. No warning, no explanation, no message. This has happened to several friends recently all without reason. I tried to contact them but the support option is fake. After trying to refuse me a support ticket I finally got a bot which gave me a block of useless text then closed my case. No humans, no support, no reason for several accounts disappearing and no reason to ever trust whatsapp again.",2024-11-05 10:29:09
Isaac Gideon,3,"This is to draw your attention to some issues that Samsung Galaxy A series users have been facing for a while now. WhatsApp doesn't work properly on these devices, especially Samsung Galaxy A15. I think it's an issue of conflicting softwares. Upon opening WhatsApp, my phone begins to lag, the screen jitters and touches are delayed. This only happens when WhatsApp is opened. I'm calling for the development team to look into this issue and help provide a solution that solves this. Thanks.",2024-11-23 16:41:26
Peter Trimmer,4,"Android user - recent update now deletes text if you add an image to send after typing. If you add image first, text can be added after. Different to how it used to work. This has been asked about on a couple of forums I use. Android users affected, iPhone still works the original way. Admin, please fix. This is a frustrating update.",2024-12-27 06:42:52
Your Trucking,3,Calls could be better for example: I am on a call to a friend and they are saying something it decided to mute what they ate saying or I understand the last few words. The messaging side is ok 👍 Uploading large videos sometimes takes its time and no its not my interent I have sent large files on another platform in shorter time. Following these improvements you would score 4/5 To gain the final star it would be beneficial to make a photo folder to easily access new and old images.,2024-12-05 20:35:28
Dewie Vogelsanger,1,Whatever update they've made to the attachment option. Now I can't access all the folders on my phone it just has them all under recent or there's 4 folders but thats not all of them. Meta really making me want work to move to another platform. The AI search being added is unnecessary and not having the search button always available is stupid. Having to scroll all the way up is ridiculous.,2024-12-22 01:35:43
Ritwika Goswami,1,"There should be an option to disconnect WhatsApp from Internet connection. Edit: It's a number based platform which allows to receive incoming calls, however scams and unwanted callers call too. There should be an option to stop receiving calls from unknown numbers. They can call/text us only if we allow them to. Without this feature it's getting dangerous to use this app, just can't switch because of official reasons.",2024-11-29 09:31:04
Igbe Emily,1,"This new algorithm is very bad, if I want to post a picture it takes 4 to 6 minutes before the picture will load talk more of been posted, the fact that the time arrangement features of the statuses are based on frequently texted is annoying, I hate this app,please do something about that delay from when I'm about to post a picture cus it's extremely annoying",2024-12-11 19:04:47
robodu,1,"This app used to work well for what it was worth but sometime this year, it began freezing and crashing incessantly on my phone so much that I couldn't use it. Mind you, it only happens on this app, every other app works smoothly. Researched and found out that this is a very common problem with WhatsApp on Samsung phones. Pls fix it! This is very annoying",2024-12-29 07:23:35
Bella Pearl,1,"For some reason my locked chats folder is no longer visible. The only responses I got from WhatsApp was from their bot, that after offering solutions that I tried and none worked said it was puzzled. Rather than a human agent entering the chat, the bot changed the subject and said that they don't provide support for the other subject that has nothing to do with my matter. Then it stopped responding. Do better WhatsApp. I have work-related chats I cannot access because of this failing.",2024-10-18 11:48:03
KELVIN LAM,5,"Been Good. Since having mobile data, this is the default communication App. One suggestion to the developer, as we communicate with one another, making an appointment with a friend or a group is common. Many apps have integration with Calendar. Maybe WhatsApp can also have some kind of events/calendar function integration?",2025-01-03 06:18:00
Steve Surname,3,"I used to appreciate this app alot, still do. But now that it's becoming very common for more and more people to use this app for calls aswell, it's become very obvious to me that -after all these years- the quality for voice calls is still unacceptable. There seems to be a constant risk of WhatsApp repeatedly ""reconnecting to the network"" even if both/all participants have full network signal. This applies to both, mobile internet aswell as WiFi. Very disappointing, would give 5* otherwise.",2025-03-14 14:02:22
NARUTO AMV,1,"WhatsApp is the best at what it offers. However, since the last major update on its voice & video call user interface, the ""end-to-end encryption"" appears before the ""calling/ringing"" information on top of the screen. That is so annoying when you are in a hurry and want to see whether or not that contact is online via the ringing info. Remove the ""end-to-end encryption"" message above the call or just put it somewhere else! That's not as important as knowing if that contact is online or not.",2024-12-20 12:48:52
Champagne Supremacy,3,"WhatsApp is really great, but I wish they had a scheduling feature for sending messages in the standard version.

Adeola Adeyemi,1,"WhatsApp is an amazing app; kudos to the brains behind it! However, I don't like how my contact status is displayed. I have to swipe over... contacts or search. I find that feature very annoying and stressful. Can it be rectified? If yes, please help! I'm dissatisfied at the moment. The feature came on in less than 24hours.

The only thing you can do is end the call..after making the person wait on line, it's horrible. And the auto rotation, is still completely broken now. When it's supposed to be in landscape it's portrait and vise versa. It cuts off most of the video cause it's in the wrong Orientation.
